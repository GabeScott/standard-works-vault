# LDS Scripture Vault — Verse-Level Notes for the Standard Works

Welcome to the **Standard Works Vault**, an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault designed to support in-depth study of the scriptures used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This repository contains a note for **every single verse** in the Standard Works:

- The Holy Bible (KJV)
- The Book of Mormon
- Doctrine and Covenants
- The Pearl of Great Price
- General Conference Talks

Each verse has its own dedicated `.md` file, enabling powerful cross-referencing, personal commentary, and integration with Obsidian’s linking and search capabilities.
