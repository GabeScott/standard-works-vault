# JST John 1.28

> He it is of whom I bear record. He is that prophet, even Elias, who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoeâ€™s latchet I am not worthy to unloose, or whose place I am not able to fill; for he shall baptize, not only with water, but with fire, and with the Holy Ghost.
