# 2 Peter 2:20

> For if after they have <u>escaped</u>[^a] the <u>pollutions</u>[^b] of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are <u>again</u>[^c] <u>entangled</u>[^d] therein, and <u>overcome</u>[^e], the latter end is <u>worse</u>[^f] with them than the beginning.
