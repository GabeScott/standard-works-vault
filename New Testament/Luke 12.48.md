# Luke 12:48

> But he that <u>knew not</u>[^a], and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be <u>beaten</u>[^b] with few stripes. For unto whomsoever <u>much</u>[^c] is <u>given</u>[^d], of him shall be much <u>required</u>[^e] : and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
