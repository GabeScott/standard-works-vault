[John 5:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/5.1?lang=eng#p1)


[^a]: The Koine Greek manuscripts of the Gospels (Byzantine) read “the feast,” implicitly the [Passover](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/passover?lang=eng). See also Matt. 26:5. Some earlier manuscripts do not make this identification. TG [Passover](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/passover?lang=eng).
