# Matthew 16:15

> He saith unto them, But whom say <u>ye</u>[^a] that I am?

[Matthew 16:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.15?lang=eng#p15)


[^a]: IEÂ The plural pronoun used here in the Greek indicates that Jesus asked this question of all the apostles and not just one of them.
