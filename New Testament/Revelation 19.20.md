# Revelation 19:20

> And the beast was taken, and with him the <u>false prophet</u>[^a] that wrought <u>miracles</u>[^b] before him, with which he <u>deceived</u>[^c] them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a <u>lake</u>[^d] of <u>fire</u>[^e] burning with brimstone.
