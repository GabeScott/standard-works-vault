# 2 Corinthians 11:9

> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was <u>chargeable</u>[^a] to no man: for that which was <u>lacking</u>[^b] to me the brethren which came from Macedonia <u>supplied</u>[^c] : and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
