# Luke 17:21

> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the <u>kingdom</u>[^a] of God <u>is</u>[^b] <u>within</u>[^c] you.

[Luke 17:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17.21?lang=eng#p21)


[^a]: [[D&C 65.2|D&C 65:2.]]
[^b]: JST Luke 17:21 … has already come unto you.
[^c]: Many translations read “among” because the pronoun “you” is plural here in Greek.
