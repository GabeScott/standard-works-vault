# 2 Peter 3:10

> But the <u>day</u>[^a] of the Lord will <u>come</u>[^b] as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall <u>pass away</u>[^c] with a great noise, and the <u>elements</u>[^d] shall melt with fervent heat, the <u>earth</u>[^e] also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
