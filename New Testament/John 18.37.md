# John 18:37

> <u>Pilate</u>[^a] therefore said unto him, Art thou a <u>king</u>[^b] then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a <u>king</u>[^c] . To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the <u>truth</u>[^d] . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
