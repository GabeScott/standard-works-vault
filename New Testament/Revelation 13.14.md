# Revelation 13:14

> And <u>deceiveth</u>[^a] them that dwell on the earth by the means of those <u>miracles</u>[^b] which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
