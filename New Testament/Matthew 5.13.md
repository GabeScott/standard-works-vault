# Matthew 5:13

> Â¶ Ye are the <u>salt</u>[^a] of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

[Matthew 5:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.13?lang=eng#p13)


[^a]: See Lev. 2:13 and Num. 18:19, where salt is a token of the covenant and was part of sacrificial ritual. TG [[Salt]].
