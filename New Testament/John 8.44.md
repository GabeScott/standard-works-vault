# John 8:44

> Ye are of your father the <u>devil</u>[^a], and the <u>lusts</u>[^b] of your father ye will do. He was a <u>murderer</u>[^c] from the beginning, and abode not in the <u>truth</u>[^d], because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a <u>lie</u>[^e], he speaketh of his own: for he is a <u>liar</u>[^f], and the father of it.
