# Revelation 20:4

> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and <u>judgment</u>[^a] was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and <u>reigned</u>[^b] with Christ a <u>thousand</u>[^c] years.
