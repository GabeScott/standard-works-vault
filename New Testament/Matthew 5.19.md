# Matthew 5:19

> <u>Whosoever</u>[^a] therefore shall <u>break</u>[^b] one of these least commandments, and shall <u>teach</u>[^c] men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and <u>teach</u>[^d] them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
