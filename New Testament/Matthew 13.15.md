# Matthew 13:15

> For this peopleâ€™s <u>heart</u>[^a] is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their <u>eyes</u>[^b] they have <u>closed</u>[^c]; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should <u>heal</u>[^d] them.
