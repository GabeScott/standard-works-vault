# 1 Corinthians 10:13

> There hath no temptation <u>taken</u>[^a] you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be <u>tempted</u>[^b] above that ye are able; but will with the <u>temptation</u>[^c] also make a way to <u>escape</u>[^d], that ye may be able to <u>bear</u>[^e] it.
