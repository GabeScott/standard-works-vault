# Matthew 10:25

> It is enough for the disciple <u>that he be</u>[^a] as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?

[Matthew 10:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10.25?lang=eng#p25)


[^a]: GRÂ that he become.
