# Joseph Smith History 1:40

> In addition to these, he quoted the <u>eleventh chapter</u>[^a] of Isaiah , saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that <u>prophet</u>[^b] was Christ; but the day had not yet come when “they who would not hear his voice should be <u>cut off</u>[^c] from among the people,” but soon would come.
