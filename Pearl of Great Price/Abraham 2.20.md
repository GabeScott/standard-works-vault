# Abraham 2:20

> And I, Abraham, arose from the place of the altar which I had built unto the Lord, and removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of <u>Bethel</u>[^a], and pitched my tent there, Bethel on the west, and <u>Hai</u>[^b] on the east; and there I built another <u>altar</u>[^c] unto the Lord, and <u>called</u>[^d] again upon the name of the Lord.
