# Joseph Smith History 1:16

> But, exerting all my powers to <u>call</u>[^a] upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into <u>despair</u>[^b] and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of <u>light</u>[^c] exactly over my head, above the brightness of the <u>sun</u>[^d], which descended gradually until it fell upon me.
