# Joseph Smith History 1:11

> While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the <u>Epistle of James</u>[^a], first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
