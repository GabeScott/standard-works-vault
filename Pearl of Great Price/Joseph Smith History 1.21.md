# Joseph Smith History 1:21

> Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had. I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as <u>visions</u>[^a] or <u>revelations</u>[^b] in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.
