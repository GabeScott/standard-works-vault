# Moses 6:63

> And behold, all things have their <u>likeness</u>[^a], and all things are created and made to <u>bear record</u>[^b] of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me.
