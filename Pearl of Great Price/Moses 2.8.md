# Moses 2:8

> And I, God, called the firmament <u>Heaven</u>[^a]; and the evening and the morning were the second day.

[Moses 2:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2.8?lang=eng#p8)


[^a]: IE The whole expanse around about the earth, its atmosphere, and beyond are generically here called “Heaven.” The same word is also used sometimes to refer to paradise, to the dwelling place of God, and to the kingdoms of glory.
