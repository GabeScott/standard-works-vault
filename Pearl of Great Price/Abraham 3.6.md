# Abraham 3:6

> And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these <u>two</u>[^a] facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth upon which thou standest, and the set time of the greater light which is set to rule the day, and the set time of the lesser light which is set to rule the night.
