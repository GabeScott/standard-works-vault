# Moses 6:57

> Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere, must <u>repent</u>[^a], or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no <u>unclean thing</u>[^b] can dwell there, or <u>dwell</u>[^c] in his <u>presence</u>[^d]; for, in the language of Adam, <u>Man</u>[^e] of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the <u>Son of Man</u>[^f], even <u>Jesus Christ</u>[^g], a righteous <u>Judge</u>[^h], who shall come in the meridian of time.
