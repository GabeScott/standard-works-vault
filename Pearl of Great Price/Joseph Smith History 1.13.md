# Joseph Smith History 1:13

> At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in <u>darkness</u>[^a] and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to “ask of God,” concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would <u>give</u>[^b] liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.
