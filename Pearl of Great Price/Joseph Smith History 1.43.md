# Joseph Smith History 1:43

> After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he <u>ascended</u>[^a] till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.
