# Joseph Smith History 1:59

> At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to <u>me</u>[^a] with this charge: that I should be <u>responsible</u>[^b] for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any <u>neglect</u>[^c] of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to <u>preserve</u>[^d] them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.
