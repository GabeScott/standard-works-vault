# Joseph Smith History 1:26

> I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned—that it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until further <u>directed</u>[^a] . I had found the testimony of James to be true—that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be <u>upbraided</u>[^b] .
