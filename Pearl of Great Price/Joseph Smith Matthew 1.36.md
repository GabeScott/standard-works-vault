# Joseph Smith Matthew 1:36

> And, as I said before, after the <u>tribulation</u>[^a] of those days, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth <u>mourn</u>[^b]; and they shall see the <u>Son of Man</u>[^c] <u>coming</u>[^d] in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;
