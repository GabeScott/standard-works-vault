# Joseph Smith History 1:50

> I obeyed; I returned to my <u>father</u>[^a] in the field, and rehearsed the whole matter to him. He <u>replied</u>[^b] to me that it was of God, and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew the place the instant that I arrived there.
