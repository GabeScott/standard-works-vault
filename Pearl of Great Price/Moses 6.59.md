# Moses 6:59

> That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the <u>spirit</u>[^a], which I have made, and so became of <u>dust</u>[^b] a living soul, even so ye must be <u>born again</u>[^c] into the kingdom of heaven, of <u>water</u>[^d], and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, and <u>enjoy</u>[^e] the <u>words</u>[^f] of <u>eternal life</u>[^g] in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal <u>glory</u>[^h];
