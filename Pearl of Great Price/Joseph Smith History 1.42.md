# Joseph Smith History 1:42

> Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken—for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled—I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be <u>destroyed</u>[^a] . While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my <u>mind</u>[^b] that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.
