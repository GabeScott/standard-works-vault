# Abraham 1:31

> But the <u>records</u>[^a] of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; therefore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the <u>planets</u>[^b], and of the stars, as they were made known unto the fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this <u>record</u>[^c], for the benefit of my posterity that shall come after me.
