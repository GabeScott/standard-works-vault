> While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a <u>light</u>[^a] appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a <u>personage</u>[^b] appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.
