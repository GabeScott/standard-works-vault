# Abraham 1:17

> And this because they have turned their <u>hearts</u>[^a] away from me, to worship the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; therefore I have come down to <u>visit</u>[^b] them, and to destroy him who hath lifted up his hand against thee, Abraham, my son, to take away thy life.
