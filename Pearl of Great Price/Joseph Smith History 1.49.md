# Joseph Smith History 1:49

> The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to my <u>father</u>[^a] and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received.
