# Joseph Smith History 1:25

> So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two <u>Personages</u>[^a], and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was <u>hated</u>[^b] and <u>persecuted</u>[^c] for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me <u>falsely</u>[^d] for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not <u>deny</u>[^e] it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.
