# Joseph Smith History 1:27

> I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty-first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued to <u>affirm</u>[^a] that I had seen a vision.
