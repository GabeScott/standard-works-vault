# Moses 7:30

> And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of <u>earths</u>[^a] like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy <u>creations</u>[^b]; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever;
