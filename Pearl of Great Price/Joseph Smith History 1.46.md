# Joseph Smith History 1:46

> By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in <u>astonishment</u>[^a] at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to <u>tempt</u>[^b] me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my fatherâ€™s family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting <u>rich</u>[^c] . This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other <u>motive</u>[^d] than that of building his kingdom; otherwise I could not get them.
