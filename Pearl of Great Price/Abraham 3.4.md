# Abraham 3:4

> And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its <u>times</u>[^a] and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a <u>day</u>[^b] unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand <u>years</u>[^c] according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord’s <u>time</u>[^d], according to the reckoning of Kolob.
