# Abraham 1:11

> Now, this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time, who were the daughters of Onitah, one of the royal descent directly from the loins of <u>Ham</u>[^a] . These virgins were offered up because of their virtue; they would not <u>bow</u>[^b] down to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they were killed upon this altar, and it was done after the manner of the Egyptians.
