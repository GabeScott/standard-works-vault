# Moses 7:56

> And he heard a loud voice; and the heavens were <u>veiled</u>[^a]; and all the creations of God mourned; and the earth <u>groaned</u>[^b]; and the rocks were rent; and the <u>saints</u>[^c] arose, and were <u>crowned</u>[^d] at the <u>right hand</u>[^e] of the Son of Man, with crowns of glory;
