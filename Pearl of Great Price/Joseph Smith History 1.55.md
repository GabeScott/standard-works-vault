# Joseph Smith History 1:55

> As my father’s worldly circumstances were very limited, we were under the necessity of <u>laboring</u>[^a] with our hands, hiring out by day’s work and otherwise, as we could get opportunity. Sometimes we were at home, and sometimes abroad, and by continuous <u>labor</u>[^b] were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance.
