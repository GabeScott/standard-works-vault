# Articles of Faith 1:13

> <u>We</u>[^a] believe in being <u>honest</u>[^b], true, <u>chaste</u>[^c], <u>benevolent</u>[^d], virtuous, and in doing <u>good</u>[^e] to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we <u>hope</u>[^f] all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to <u>endure</u>[^g] all things. If there is anything <u>virtuous</u>[^h], <u>lovely</u>[^i], or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.
