# Joseph Smith History 1:19

> I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all <u>wrong</u>[^a]; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those <u>professors</u>[^b] were all <u>corrupt</u>[^c]; that: “they <u>draw near</u>[^d] to me with their lips, but their <u>hearts</u>[^e] are far from me, they teach for doctrines the <u>commandments</u>[^f] of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the <u>power</u>[^g] thereof.”
