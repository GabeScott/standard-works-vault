# Abraham 1:20

> Behold, Potipharâ€™s Hill was in the land of <u>Ur</u>[^a], of Chaldea. And the Lord broke down the altar of Elkenah, and of the gods of the land, and utterly destroyed them, and smote the priest that he died; and there was great mourning in Chaldea, and also in the court of Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.
