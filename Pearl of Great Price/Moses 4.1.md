> And I, the <u>Lord God</u>[^a], spake unto Moses, saying: That <u>Satan</u>[^b], whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the <u>beginning</u>[^c], and he came before me, sayingâ€”Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will <u>redeem</u>[^d] all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely <u>I</u>[^e] will do it; wherefore <u>give</u>[^f] me thine honor.
