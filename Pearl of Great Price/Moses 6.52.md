> And he also said unto him: If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, and be <u>baptized</u>[^a], even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of <u>grace</u>[^b] and truth, which is <u>Jesus Christ</u>[^c], the only <u>name</u>[^d] which shall be given under heaven, whereby <u>salvation</u>[^e] shall come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, it shall be given you.
