# Moses 7:62

> And <u>righteousness</u>[^a] will I send down out of heaven; and truth will I send forth out of the earth, to bear <u>testimony</u>[^b] of mine Only Begotten; his <u>resurrection</u>[^c] from the dead; yea, and also the resurrection of all men; and righteousness and truth will I cause to sweep the earth as with a flood, to <u>gather</u>[^d] out mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, unto a place which I shall prepare, an Holy City, that my people may gird up their loins, and be looking forth for the time of my coming; for there shall be my tabernacle, and it shall be called <u>Zion</u>[^e], a <u>New Jerusalem</u>[^f] .
