# Moses 1:11

> But now mine own eyes have <u>beheld</u>[^a] God; but not my <u>natural</u>[^b], but my <u>spiritual</u>[^c] eyes, for my <u>natural</u>[^d] eyes could not have <u>beheld</u>[^e]; for I should have <u>withered</u>[^f] and <u>died</u>[^g] in his presence; but his <u>glory</u>[^h] was upon me; and I beheld his <u>face</u>[^i], for I was <u>transfigured</u>[^j] before him.
