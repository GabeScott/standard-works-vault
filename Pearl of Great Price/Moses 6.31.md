# Moses 6:31

> And when Enoch had heard these words, he <u>bowed</u>[^a] himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord, saying: <u>Why</u>[^b] is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people <u>hate</u>[^c] me; for I am <u>slow</u>[^d] of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?
