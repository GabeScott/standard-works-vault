# Moses 5:13

> And <u>Satan</u>[^a] came among them, saying: I am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying: <u>Believe</u>[^b] it not; and they believed it not, and they <u>loved</u>[^c] Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be <u>carnal</u>[^d], sensual, and devilish.
