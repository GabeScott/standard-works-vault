# Joseph Smith History 1:23

> It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure <u>boy</u>[^a], of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily <u>labor</u>[^b], should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter <u>persecution</u>[^c] and <u>reviling</u>[^d] . But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself.
