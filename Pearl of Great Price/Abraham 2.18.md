# Abraham 2:18

> And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem; it was situated in the plains of Moreh, and we had already come into the borders of the land of the <u>Canaanites</u>[^a], and I offered <u>sacrifice</u>[^b] there in the plains of Moreh, and called on the Lord devoutly, because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation.
