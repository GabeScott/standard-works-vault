# Abraham 5:3

> And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would <u>rest</u>[^a] from all their <u>works</u>[^b] which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and <u>sanctified</u>[^c] it. And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth.
