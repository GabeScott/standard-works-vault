# Abraham 3:9

> And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one <u>planet</u>[^a] above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lordâ€™s time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same <u>order</u>[^b] as that upon which thou standest.
