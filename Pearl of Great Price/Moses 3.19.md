# Moses 3:19

> And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every <u>beast</u>[^a] of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the <u>breath of life</u>[^b], and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.
