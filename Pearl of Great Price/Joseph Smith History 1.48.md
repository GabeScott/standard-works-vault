# Joseph Smith History 1:48

> I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found my <u>strength</u>[^a] so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed me, and I <u>fell</u>[^b] helpless on the ground, and for a time was quite unconscious of anything.
