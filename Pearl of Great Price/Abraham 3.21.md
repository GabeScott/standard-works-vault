# Abraham 3:21

> I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, therefore, have come down unto thee to declare unto thee the <u>works</u>[^a] which my hands have made, wherein my <u>wisdom</u>[^b] excelleth them all, for I <u>rule</u>[^c] in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen.
