# Joseph Smith Matthew 1:4

> And Jesus left them, and went upon the Mount of Olives. And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying: Tell us when shall these things be which thou hast said concerning the destruction of the temple, and the Jews; and what is the <u>sign</u>[^a] of thy <u>coming</u>[^b], and of the <u>end</u>[^c] of the world, or the destruction of the <u>wicked</u>[^d], which is the end of the world?
