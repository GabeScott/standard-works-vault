# Abraham 3:18

> Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there be two <u>spirits</u>[^a], and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are <u>gnolaum</u>[^b], or eternal.
