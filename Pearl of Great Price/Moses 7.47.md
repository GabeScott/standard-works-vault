> And behold, Enoch <u>saw</u>[^a] the day of the coming of the Son of Man, even in the flesh; and his soul rejoiced, saying: The Righteous is lifted up, and the <u>Lamb</u>[^b] is slain from the foundation of the world; and through <u>faith</u>[^c] I am in the bosom of the Father, and behold, <u>Zion</u>[^d] is with me.
