# Joseph Smith History 1:14

> So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the <u>woods</u>[^a] to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a <u>beautiful</u>[^b], clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to <u>pray</u>[^c] <u>vocally</u>[^d] .
