# Moses 7:48

> And it came to pass that Enoch looked upon the <u>earth</u>[^a]; and he heard a voice from the bowels thereof, saying: Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; I am <u>pained</u>[^b], I am weary, because of the wickedness of my children. When shall I <u>rest</u>[^c], and be <u>cleansed</u>[^d] from the <u>filthiness</u>[^e] which is gone forth out of me? When will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest, and righteousness for a season abide upon my face?
