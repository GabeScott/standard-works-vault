# Joseph Smith History 1:62

> By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates. I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the <u>Urim and Thummim</u>[^a] I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wifeâ€™s father, in the month of December, and the February following.
