# Moses 5:16

> And Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to call upon God. And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare <u>Cain</u>[^a], and said: I have gotten a man from the Lord; wherefore he may not reject his words. But behold, Cain <u>hearkened</u>[^b] not, saying: Who is the Lord that I should <u>know</u>[^c] him?
