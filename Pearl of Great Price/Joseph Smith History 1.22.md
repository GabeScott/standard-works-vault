# Joseph Smith History 1:22

> I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great <u>persecution</u>[^a], which continued to increase; and though I was an <u>obscure</u>[^b] boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sectsâ€”all united to persecute me.
