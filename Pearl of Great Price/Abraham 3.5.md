# Abraham 3:5

> And the Lord said unto me: The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule the day, even the night, is above or <u>greater</u>[^a] than that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning, for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of days, and of months, and of years.

[^a]: IE It rotates on its axis more slowly. See also v. 7.
