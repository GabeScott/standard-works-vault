# Joseph Smith History 1:58

> Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, <u>persecution</u>[^a] still followed me, and my wife’s father’s family were very much opposed to our being married. I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and went to my father’s, and <u>farmed</u>[^b] with him that season.
