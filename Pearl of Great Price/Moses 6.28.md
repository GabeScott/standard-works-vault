# Moses 6:28

> And for these many generations, ever since the day that I created them, have they gone astray, and have <u>denied</u>[^a] me, and have sought their own counsels in the dark; and in their own abominations have they devised murder, and have not kept the commandments, which I gave unto their father, Adam.
