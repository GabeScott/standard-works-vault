# Moses 5:52

> Wherefore the Lord <u>cursed</u>[^a] Lamech, and his house, and all them that had covenanted with Satan; for they kept not the commandments of God, and it displeased God, and he ministered not unto them, and their works were abominations, and began to spread among all the <u>sons</u>[^b] of men. And it was among the sons of men.
