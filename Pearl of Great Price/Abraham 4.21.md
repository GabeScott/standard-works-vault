# Abraham 4:21

> And the Gods prepared the waters that they might bring forth great <u>whales</u>[^a], and every living creature that moveth, which the waters were to bring forth abundantly after their kind; and every winged fowl after their kind. And the Gods saw that they would be obeyed, and that their plan was good.
