# Joseph Smith History 1:32

> Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was <u>glorious</u>[^a] beyond description, and his countenance truly like <u>lightning</u>[^b] . The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was <u>afraid</u>[^c]; but the <u>fear</u>[^d] soon left me.
