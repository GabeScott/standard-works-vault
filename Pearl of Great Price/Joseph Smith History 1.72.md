# Joseph Smith History 1:72

> The <u>messenger</u>[^a] who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called <u>John the Baptist</u>[^b] in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of <u>Peter</u>[^c], James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first <u>Elder</u>[^d] of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger, and baptized.
