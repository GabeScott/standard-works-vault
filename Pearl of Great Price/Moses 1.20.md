# Moses 1:20

> And it came to pass that Moses began to <u>fear</u>[^a] exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of <u>hell</u>[^b] . Nevertheless, <u>calling</u>[^c] upon God, he received <u>strength</u>[^d], and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of <u>glory</u>[^e] .
