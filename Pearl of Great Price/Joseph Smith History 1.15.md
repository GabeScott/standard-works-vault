# Joseph Smith History 1:15

> After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was <u>seized</u>[^a] upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick <u>darkness</u>[^b] gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.
