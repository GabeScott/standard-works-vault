# Moses 3:7

> And I, the Lord God, formed man from the <u>dust</u>[^a] of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the <u>breath of life</u>[^b]; and <u>man</u>[^c] became a living <u>soul</u>[^d], the <u>first</u>[^e] flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.
