# Moses 5:1

> And it came to pass that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that Adam began to till the earth, and to have <u>dominion</u>[^a] over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his <u>brow</u>[^b], as I the Lord had commanded him. And Eve, also, his wife, did <u>labor</u>[^c] with him.
