# Joseph Smith History 1:29

> In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to <u>prayer</u>[^a] and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full <u>confidence</u>[^b] in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.
