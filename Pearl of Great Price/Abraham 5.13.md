# Abraham 5:13

> But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lordâ€™s <u>time</u>[^a], which was after the time of <u>Kolob</u>[^b]; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning.
