# Abraham 2:6

> But I, Abraham, and Lot, my brother’s son, prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord <u>appeared</u>[^a] unto me, and said unto me: Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran, and to make of thee a <u>minister</u>[^b] to bear my <u>name</u>[^c] in a strange <u>land</u>[^d] which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice.
