# Moses 3:9

> And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, <u>naturally</u>[^a], that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also a <u>living</u>[^b] soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the <u>tree of life</u>[^c] also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
