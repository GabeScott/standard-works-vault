# Moses 8:24

> <u>Believe</u>[^a] and repent of your sins and be <u>baptized</u>[^b] in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made <u>manifest</u>[^c]; and if ye do not this, the floods will come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not.
