# Joseph Smith History 1:17

> It no sooner appeared than I found myself <u>delivered</u>[^a] from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I <u>saw</u>[^b] two <u>Personages</u>[^c], whose brightness and <u>glory</u>[^d] defy all description, <u>standing</u>[^e] above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other— This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!
