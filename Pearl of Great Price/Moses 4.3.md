# Moses 4:3

> Wherefore, because that <u>Satan</u>[^a] <u>rebelled</u>[^b] against me, and sought to destroy the <u>agency</u>[^c] of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be <u>cast down</u>[^d];
