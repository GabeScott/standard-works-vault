# Moses 7:13

> And so great was the <u>faith</u>[^a] of Enoch that he led the people of God, and their enemies came to battle against them; and he <u>spake</u>[^b] the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the <u>mountains</u>[^c] fled, even according to his command; and the <u>rivers</u>[^d] of water were turned out of their course; and the roar of the lions was heard out of the wilderness; and all nations feared greatly, so <u>powerful</u>[^e] was the word of Enoch, and so great was the power of the language which God had given him.
