# Abraham 1:26

> Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that <u>order</u>[^a] established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with the <u>blessings</u>[^b] of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood.
