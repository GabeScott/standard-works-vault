# Moses 6:15

> And the children of <u>men</u>[^a] were numerous upon all the face of the land. And in those days <u>Satan</u>[^b] had great <u>dominion</u>[^c] among men, and raged in their hearts; and from thenceforth came <u>wars</u>[^d] and bloodshed; and a manâ€™s hand was against his own brother, in administering death, because of <u>secret</u>[^e] <u>works</u>[^f], seeking for <u>power</u>[^g] .
