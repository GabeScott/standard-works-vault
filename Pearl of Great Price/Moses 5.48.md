# Moses 5:48

> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech shall be <u>seventy and seven fold</u>[^a];

[Moses 5:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.48?lang=eng#p48)


[^a]: IE Lamech presumptively boasted that far more would be done for him than for Cain. The reasons for his assumption are given in verses 49 and 50.
