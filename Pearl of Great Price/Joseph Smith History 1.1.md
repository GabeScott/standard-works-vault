# Joseph Smith History 1:1

> Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed and designing persons, in relation to the rise and progress of <u>The</u>[^a] Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have been designed by the authors thereof to militate against its character as a Church and its progress in the worldâ€”I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in possession of the <u>facts</u>[^b], as they have transpired, in relation both to myself and the Church, so far as I have such facts in my possession.
