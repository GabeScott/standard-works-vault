# Moses 3:5

> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, <u>created</u>[^a] all things, of which I have spoken, <u>spiritually</u>[^b], before they were <u>naturally</u>[^c] upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had <u>created</u>[^d] all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the <u>ground</u>[^e]; for in <u>heaven</u>[^f] <u>created</u>[^g] I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;
