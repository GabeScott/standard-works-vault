# Moses 5:42

> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch, and he also begat many sons and daughters. And he builded a city, and he called the name of the <u>city</u>[^a] after the name of his son, Enoch.

[Moses 5:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.42?lang=eng#p42)


[^a]: IE There was a man named Enoch in Cain’s lineage, and a city by that name among his people. Do not confuse these with the Enoch of the righteous line of Seth and with his city, Zion, also called “City of Enoch.”
