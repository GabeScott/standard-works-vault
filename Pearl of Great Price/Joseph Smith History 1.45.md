# Joseph Smith History 1:45

> He commenced, and <u>again</u>[^a] related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great <u>judgments</u>[^b] which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by <u>famine</u>[^c], <u>sword</u>[^d], and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had done before.
