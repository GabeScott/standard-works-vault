# Joseph Smith History 1:65

> “He then said to me, ‘Let me see that certificate.’ I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of <u>angels</u>[^a], and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates were <u>sealed</u>[^b], and that I was forbidden to bring them. He replied, ‘I cannot read a sealed book.’ I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.”
