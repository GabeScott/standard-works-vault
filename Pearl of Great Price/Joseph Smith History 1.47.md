# Joseph Smith History 1:47

> After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to <u>ponder</u>[^a] on the strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night.
