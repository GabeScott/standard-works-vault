# Joseph Smith History 1:12

> Never did any passage of <u>scripture</u>[^a] come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed <u>wisdom</u>[^b] from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects <u>understood</u>[^c] the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.
