# Abraham 1:7

> Therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the <u>heathen</u>[^a] in offering up their children unto these dumb idols, and hearkened not unto my voice, but endeavored to take away my <u>life</u>[^b] by the hand of the priest of Elkenah. The priest of Elkenah was also the priest of Pharaoh.
