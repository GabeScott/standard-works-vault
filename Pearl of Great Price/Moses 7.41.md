# Moses 7:41

> And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Enoch, and <u>told</u>[^a] Enoch all the doings of the children of men; wherefore Enoch knew, and looked upon their wickedness, and their misery, and wept and stretched forth his arms, and his <u>heart</u>[^b] swelled wide as eternity; and his bowels yearned; and all eternity shook.
