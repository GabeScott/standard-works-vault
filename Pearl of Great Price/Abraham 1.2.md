# Abraham 1:2

> And, finding there was greater <u>happiness</u>[^a] and peace and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of <u>righteousness</u>[^b], desiring also to be one who possessed great <u>knowledge</u>[^c], and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a father of many <u>nations</u>[^d], a prince of peace, and <u>desiring</u>[^e] to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a <u>High Priest</u>[^f], holding the right belonging to the fathers.
