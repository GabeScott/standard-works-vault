President N. Eldon Tanner

We shall now present the General Authorities, General Officers, and General Auxiliary Officers of the Church for the sustaining vote of the General Conference.

Before doing that, however, we desire to release with a vote of thanks for the excellent services they have rendered, the Presiding Bishopric of the Church: John H. Vandenberg, Presiding Bishop; Robert L. Simpson, first counselor; and Victor L. Brown, second counselor. These brethren have served ably and faithfully for many years, and we want them to know of our sincere appreciation for their valued service. Will those who would like to join with us in extending a vote of love and appreciation to them, signify it in the usual manner. (A vote of appreciation was extended to these brethren of the Presiding Bishopric by the uplifted hands of the congregation.)
