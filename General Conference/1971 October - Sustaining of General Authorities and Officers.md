President Harold B. Lee

You will notice that two chairs are vacantâ€”Elder Hugh B. Brown of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Elder Alma Sonne, an Assistant to the Twelve. Upon the advice of their doctors, they have remained at home. We have been hopeful that they might be able to attend at least one of the sessions before the conference ends. Other than that, all of the General Authorities are in attendance.
