Our recent Gong family reunion included a fun talent show, complete with a dad jokes contest.

But this contest was unusual. On one team was Grandpa (me) and two of the grandchildren, ages 12 and 11. On the other team was an artificial intelligence (AI) program prompted by a cousin to tell dad jokes in the style of Gerrit W. Gong. Grandpa Gerrit Gong versus AI Gerrit Gong.

The grandchildren and I went first.

What do you call a dinosaur who crashes his car? Tyrannosaurus Wrecks.

AI Gerrit Gong was instructed—think like Gerrit W. Gong. Talk like him.

AI Gerrit Gong—“Here is a dad joke as if spoken by Gerrit W. Gong, embracing his warm, thoughtful, and uplifting style: Why did the humble tree make people smile? Because it was rooted in love and reached out with branches of kindness. Like that tree, we too can find strength in our roots and joy in extending kindness to others.”

Well, what do you think? That’s why they’re called dad jokes.

All around us are opportunities to laugh, delight, see with grateful eyes. Ours is a gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life. Holiness sets things apart for sacred purpose. But holiness also invites us to infuse daily living with the sacred—to rejoice in daily bread amidst this world’s thistles and thorns. To walk with the Lord, we must become holy, for He is holy,[^1] and to help us become holy, the Lord invites us to walk with Him.[^2]

We each have a story. As Sister Gong and I meet you—Church members and friends in many places and circumstances—your stories of holiness to the Lord in everyday life inspire us. You live seven Cs: **c**ommunion with God, **c**ommunity and **c**ompassion with each other, **c**ommitment and **c**ovenant with God, family, and friends—**c**entered in Jesus **C**hrist.

Growing evidence highlights this striking fact: religious believers are on average happier, healthier, and more fulfilled than those without spiritual commitment or connection. Happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, even financial and material stability—on each measure, religious practitioners flourish.[^3]

They enjoy better physical and mental health and greater life satisfaction across all ages and demographic groups.

What researchers call “religious structural stability” offers clarity, purpose, and inspiration amidst life’s twists and turns. The household of faith and community of Saints combat isolation and the lonely crowd. Holiness to the Lord says no to the profane, no to snarky cleverness at others’ expense, no to algorithms that monetize anger and polarization. Holiness to the Lord says yes to the sacred and reverent, yes to our becoming our freest, happiest, most authentic, best selves as we follow Him in faith.

What does holiness to the Lord in everyday life look like?

Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like two faithful young adults, married for a year, sharing with authenticity and vulnerability gospel covenants, sacrifice, and service in their unfolding lives.[^4]

She begins, “In high school, I was in a dark place. I felt like God wasn’t there for me. One night, a text from a friend said, ‘Hey, have you read [[Alma 36.1|Alma 36]][[Alma 36.2|]][[Alma 36.3|]][[Alma 36.4|]][[Alma 36.5|]][[Alma 36.6|]][[Alma 36.7|]][[Alma 36.8|]][[Alma 36.9|]][[Alma 36.10|]][[Alma 36.11|]][[Alma 36.12|]][[Alma 36.13|]][[Alma 36.14|]][[Alma 36.15|]][[Alma 36.16|]][[Alma 36.17|]][[Alma 36.18|]][[Alma 36.19|]][[Alma 36.20|]][[Alma 36.21|]][[Alma 36.22|]][[Alma 36.23|]][[Alma 36.24|]][[Alma 36.25|]][[Alma 36.26|]][[Alma 36.27|]][[Alma 36.28|]][[Alma 36.29|]][[Alma 36.30|]] ever?’

“As I started reading,” she said, “I was overcome with peace and love. I felt like I was being given this big hug. When I read [[Alma 36.12|Alma 36:12]], I knew Heavenly Father saw me and knew exactly how I was feeling.”

She continues, “Before we got married, I was honest with my fiancé that I didn’t have a great testimony of tithing. Why did God need us to give money when others had so much to give? My fiancé helped explain it’s not about money but following a commandment asked of us. He challenged me to start paying tithing.

“I really saw my testimony grow,” she said. “Sometimes money gets tight, but we saw so many blessings, and somehow paychecks were enough.”

Also, “in my nursing class,” she said, “I was the only member of the Church and the only one married. Many times I left class frustrated or crying because I felt classmates singled me out and made negative comments about my beliefs, my wearing my garments, or my being married so young.”

Yet she continues, “This past semester I learned how to better voice my beliefs and be a good gospel example. My knowledge and testimony grew because I was tested in my ability to stand alone and be strong in what I believe.”

The young husband adds, “Before my mission I had offers to play college baseball. Making the difficult decision, I put those offers aside and went to serve the Lord. I wouldn’t trade those two years for anything.

“Returning home,” he said, “I expected a difficult transition but found myself stronger, faster, and healthier. I was throwing harder than when I left. I had more offers to play than when I left, including my dream school. And, most importantly,” he said, “I rely upon the Lord more than ever.”

He concludes, “As a missionary I taught that Heavenly Father promises us power in our prayers, but sometimes I forget that for myself.”[^5]

Our treasury of missionary holiness-to-the-Lord blessings is rich and full.[^6] Finances, timing, and other circumstances are often not easy. But when missionaries of all ages and backgrounds consecrate holiness to the Lord, things can work out in the Lord’s time and way.

Now with a 48-year perspective, a senior missionary shares, “My dad wanted me to get a college education, not go on a mission. Shortly after that, he had a heart attack and died at age 47. I felt guilty. How could I make things right with my father?

“Later,” he continues, “after I decided to serve a mission, I saw my father in a dream. Peaceful and contented, he was happy I would serve.”

This senior missionary continues, “As [[D&C 138.1|Doctrine and Covenants section 138]][[D&C 138.2|]][[D&C 138.3|]][[D&C 138.4|]][[D&C 138.5|]][[D&C 138.6|]][[D&C 138.7|]][[D&C 138.8|]][[D&C 138.9|]][[D&C 138.10|]][[D&C 138.11|]][[D&C 138.12|]][[D&C 138.13|]][[D&C 138.14|]][[D&C 138.15|]][[D&C 138.16|]][[D&C 138.17|]][[D&C 138.18|]][[D&C 138.19|]][[D&C 138.20|]][[D&C 138.21|]][[D&C 138.22|]][[D&C 138.23|]][[D&C 138.24|]][[D&C 138.25|]][[D&C 138.26|]][[D&C 138.27|]][[D&C 138.28|]][[D&C 138.29|]][[D&C 138.30|]][[D&C 138.31|]][[D&C 138.32|]][[D&C 138.33|]][[D&C 138.34|]][[D&C 138.35|]][[D&C 138.36|]][[D&C 138.37|]][[D&C 138.38|]][[D&C 138.39|]][[D&C 138.40|]][[D&C 138.41|]][[D&C 138.42|]][[D&C 138.43|]][[D&C 138.44|]][[D&C 138.45|]][[D&C 138.46|]][[D&C 138.47|]][[D&C 138.48|]][[D&C 138.49|]][[D&C 138.50|]][[D&C 138.51|]][[D&C 138.52|]][[D&C 138.53|]][[D&C 138.54|]][[D&C 138.55|]][[D&C 138.56|]][[D&C 138.57|]][[D&C 138.58|]][[D&C 138.59|]][[D&C 138.60|]] teaches, I believe my father could serve as a missionary in the spirit world. I picture my father helping our great-grandfather, who left Germany at age 17 and was lost to the family, be found again.”

His wife adds, “Among the five brothers in my husband’s family, the four who served missions are the ones with college degrees.”

Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like a young returning missionary who learned to let God prevail in his life. Earlier, when asked to bless someone who was very sick, this missionary said, “I have faith; I will bless him to recover. Yet,” the returning missionary says, “I learned in that moment to pray not for what I wanted but for what the Lord knew the person needed. I blessed the brother with peace and comfort. He later passed away peacefully.”

Holiness to the Lord in everyday life feels like a spark arcing across the veil to connect, comfort, and strengthen. An administrator at a major university says he feels individuals he knows only by reputation praying for him. Those individuals devoted their lives to the university and continue to care about its mission and students.

A sister does her best each day, after her husband was unfaithful to her and the children. I deeply admire her and others like her. One day while folding laundry, her hand on a stack of garments, she sighed to herself, “What’s the point?” She felt a tender voice assure her, “Your covenants are with me.”[^7]

For 50 years, another sister yearned for a relationship with her father.[^8] “Growing up,” she says, “there were my brothers and my dad, and then there was me—the only daughter. All I ever wanted was to be ‘good enough’ for my dad.

“Then my mom passed away! She was my only liaison between my dad and me.

“One day,” the sister said, “I heard a voice say, ‘Invite your dad and take him to the temple with you.’ That was the beginning of a twice-a-month date with my daddy to the house of the Lord. I told my dad I loved him. He told me he loved me too.

“Spending time in the house of the Lord has healed us. My mom could not help us on earth. It took her being on the other side of the veil to help mend what was broken. The temple completed our journey to wholeness as an eternal family.”

The father says, “The temple dedication was a great spiritual experience for me and my only daughter. Now we attend together and feel our love strengthen.”

Holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes tender moments when loved ones pass. Earlier this year, my dear mother, Jean Gong, slipped into the next life days before her 98th birthday.[^9]

If you asked my mother, “Would you like rocky road, white chocolate ginger, or strawberry ice cream?” Mom would say, “Yes, please, may I taste each one?” Who could say no to your mother, especially when she loved all of life’s flavors?

I once asked Mom which decisions had most shaped her life.

She said, “Being baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moving from Hawaii to the mainland, where I met your father.”

Baptized as a 15-year-old, the only member of her large family to join our Church, my mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that blessed her life and all our family generations. I miss my mother, as you miss members in your family. But I know my mother is not gone. She is just not here now. I honor her and all who pass as valiant examples of everyday holiness to the Lord.

Of course, holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house.[^10] This is true whether we are Church members or friends.

Three friends came to the Bangkok Thailand Temple open house.

“This is a place of super healing,” said one.

In the baptistry, another said, “When I am here, I want to be washed clean and never sin again.”

The third said, “Can you feel the spiritual power?”

With nine sacred words, our temples invite and proclaim:

“Holiness to the Lord.

“The House of the Lord.”[^11]

Holiness to the Lord makes daily living sacred. It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other and prepares us to live with God our Father, Jesus Christ, and our loved ones.

As did my friend, you may wonder if your Heavenly Father loves you. The answer is a resounding, absolute yes! We can feel His love as we make holiness to the Lord ours each day, happy and forever. May we do so, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.




[^1]: From Old Testament times, we are taught, “Ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy” ([[Leviticus 11.44|Leviticus 11:44]]). We are to walk in holiness before the Lord (see [[D&C 20.69|Doctrine and Covenants 20:69]]), stand in holy places (see [[D&C 45.32|Doctrine and Covenants 45:32]]), keep the Sabbath day holy (see [[Exodus 20.8|Exodus 20:8]]), wear holy garments (see [[Exodus 29.29|Exodus 29:29]]), use holy anointing oil (see [[Exodus 30.25|Exodus 30:25]]), be blessed by holy prophets (see [[D&C 10.46|Doctrine and Covenants 10:46]]), and rely upon holy scriptures (see [[D&C 20.11|Doctrine and Covenants 20:11]]), holy laws (see [[D&C 20.20|Doctrine and Covenants 20:20]]), and holy angels (see [[D&C 20.6|Doctrine and Covenants 20:6]]). Holiness to the Lord is intended to bless all aspects of our daily life.

[^4]: Each quoted experience is shared—with my admiration and appreciation—in the words of the individuals involved and by their permission.

[^5]: Today in the Church, young adults ages 18–35 (including both young single and young married adults) and single adults (ages 36–45) constitute one-third (32.5 percent) of total Church members. Of those 5.623 million Church members, young adults ages 18–35 total in number 3.625 million (of which 694,000 are married), and single adults ages 36–45 total in number 1.998 million. Our young and single adults are outstanding; each one is precious. Each has an individual story of faith, seeking, resilience, and compassion. The example shared here is representative of the remarkable range of stories and experience young and single adults share as I meet you in many settings and circumstances across the Church.

[^6]: Currently, some 77,500 missionaries are serving in 450 missions worldwide. This includes young teaching missionaries, young service missionaries, and senior couples, but not 27,800 senior service missionaries and long-term volunteers. Each missionary story, from preparation through service and return, is individual and full of holiness to the Lord in personal experience.

[^7]: Some of our most faithful and courageous Church members, sisters and brothers, find themselves facing situations they never expected and never would have chosen. These true Saints carry on, day in and day out, often waiting on the Lord. The Lord is aware of each and, as this example tenderly shares, desires to encourage and strengthen each of us in His time and way.

[^8]: There is much longing for relationships with parents and children. I am deeply grateful for each situation in which, even after many years, reconciliation, forgiveness, and covenant belonging are created or restored. This good sister does not want anyone to think poorly of her father. She says, “He is a fine and faithful leader and a good father.”

[^9]: A paradox of parenting is that children are deeply shaped by how they are nurtured, yet they usually remember little of the early years when their mothers tirelessly, selflessly mother. Words are insufficient to express the truism that my understanding, love, and appreciation for my father and mother expanded and deepened as I became a husband, parent, and grandparent. Reflecting the generational nature of the plan of happiness, we can, in temple mirrors of eternity, see ourselves as a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother in one direction and as a daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter in the other direction.

[^10]: Today, approximately 60 percent of Church members worldwide live within 50 miles (80 km, or about an hour travel time in many places) of a house of the Lord. In coming years, as announced temples are completed, approximately three-fourths of Church members will live within an hour of a house of the Lord. Depending on circumstances, that is hopefully close enough to come often to the Lord in His holy house, thereby blessing generations of precious family members and ourselves and our posterity.

[^11]: On our temples, the standard inscription is “Holiness to the Lord, the House of the Lord.” A few temples include more than this inscription, such as adding the name of the Church. A few temples have the inscription reversed: “The House of the Lord, Holiness to the Lord” (in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and San Diego in the United States). The Logan Utah Temple inscription simply states, “Holiness to the Lord.”
