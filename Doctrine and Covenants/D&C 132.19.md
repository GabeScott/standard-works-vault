# D&C 132:19

> And again, verily I say unto you, if a man <u>marry</u>[^a] a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the <u>new and everlasting covenant</u>[^b], and it is <u>sealed</u>[^c] unto them by the Holy Spirit of <u>promise</u>[^d], by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the <u>keys</u>[^e] of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit <u>thrones</u>[^f], kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths—then shall it be written in the Lamb’s <u>Book of Life</u>[^g], that he shall commit no <u>murder</u>[^h] whereby to shed innocent <u>blood</u>[^i], and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their <u>exaltation</u>[^j] and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the <u>seeds</u>[^k] forever and ever.
