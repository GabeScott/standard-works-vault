# D&C 132:61

> And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthoodâ€”if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse <u>another</u>[^a], and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.
