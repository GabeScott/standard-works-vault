# D&C 128:11

> Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the summum bonum of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtaining the <u>powers</u>[^a] of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are given there is no difficulty in obtaining a <u>knowledge</u>[^b] of facts in relation to the <u>salvation</u>[^c] of the children of men, both as well for the dead as for the living.
