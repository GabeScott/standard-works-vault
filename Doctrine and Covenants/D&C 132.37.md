# D&C 132:37

> Abraham received <u>concubines</u>[^a], and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and <u>Jacob</u>[^b] did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their <u>exaltation</u>[^c], according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.
