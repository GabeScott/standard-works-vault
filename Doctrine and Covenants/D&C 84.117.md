# D&C 84:117

> And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, go ye forth as your circumstances shall permit, in your several callings, unto the great and notable cities and villages, <u>reproving</u>[^a] the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of <u>abomination</u>[^b] in the last days.
