# D&C 46:7

> But ye are commanded in all things to <u>ask</u>[^a] of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all <u>holiness</u>[^b] of heart, walking uprightly before me, <u>considering</u>[^c] the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and <u>thanksgiving</u>[^d], that ye may not be <u>seduced</u>[^e] by evil <u>spirits</u>[^f], or doctrines of devils, or the <u>commandments</u>[^g] of men; for some are of men, and others of devils.
