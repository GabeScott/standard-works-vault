# D&C 114:1

> Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant David W. Patten, that he settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a disposition of his merchandise, that he may <u>perform</u>[^a] a mission unto me next spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.
