# D&C 35:2

> I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was <u>crucified</u>[^a] for the sins of the world, even as many as will <u>believe</u>[^b] on my name, that they may become the <u>sons</u>[^c] of God, even <u>one</u>[^d] in <u>me</u>[^e] as I am <u>one</u>[^f] in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one.
