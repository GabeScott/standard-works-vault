# D&C 136:8

> Let each company <u>bear</u>[^a] an equal proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking the poor, the <u>widows</u>[^b], the <u>fatherless</u>[^c], and the families of those who have gone into the army, that the cries of the widow and the <u>fatherless</u>[^d] come not up into the ears of the Lord against this people.
