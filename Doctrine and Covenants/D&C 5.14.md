# D&C 5:14

> And to <u>none</u>[^a] else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my <u>church</u>[^b] out of the wilderness—clear as the <u>moon</u>[^c], and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.
