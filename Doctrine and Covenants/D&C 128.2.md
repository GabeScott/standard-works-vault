# D&C 128:2

> I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a <u>recorder</u>[^a], who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord.
