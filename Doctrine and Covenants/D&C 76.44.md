# D&C 76:44

> Wherefore, he saves all <u>except</u>[^a] them—they shall go away into <u>everlasting</u>[^b] <u>punishment</u>[^c], which is endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to <u>reign</u>[^d] with the <u>devil</u>[^e] and his angels in eternity, where their <u>worm</u>[^f] dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is their torment—
