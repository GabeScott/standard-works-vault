# D&C 132:20

> Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from <u>everlasting</u>[^a] to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be <u>gods</u>[^b], because they have <u>all power</u>[^c], and the angels are subject unto them.
