> And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and <u>give</u>[^a] her unto him that hath not committed <u>adultery</u>[^b] but hath been <u>faithful</u>[^c]; for he shall be made ruler over many.
