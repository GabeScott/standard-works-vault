# D&C 84:74

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are not <u>baptized</u>[^a] in water in my name, for the <u>remission</u>[^b] of their sins, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be <u>damned</u>[^c], and shall not come into my Father’s kingdom where my Father and I am.
