> O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this <u>bread</u>[^a] to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and <u>witness</u>[^b] unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his <u>commandments</u>[^c] which he has given them; that they may always have his <u>Spirit</u>[^d] to be with them. Amen.
