# D&C 43:25

> How oft have I <u>called upon</u>[^a] you by the mouth of my <u>servants</u>[^b], and by the <u>ministering</u>[^c] of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of <u>thunderings</u>[^d], and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of <u>famines</u>[^e] and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a <u>trump</u>[^f], and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of <u>mercy</u>[^g] all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the <u>riches</u>[^h] of eternal life, and would have saved you with an <u>everlasting</u>[^i] salvation, but ye would not!
