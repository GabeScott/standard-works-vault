# D&C 29:13

> For a <u>trump</u>[^a] shall sound both long and loud, even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the <u>earth</u>[^b] shall quake, and they shall <u>come</u>[^c] forthâ€”yea, even the <u>dead</u>[^d] which died in me, to receive a <u>crown</u>[^e] of righteousness, and to be clothed upon, <u>even</u>[^f] as I am, to be with me, that we may be one.
