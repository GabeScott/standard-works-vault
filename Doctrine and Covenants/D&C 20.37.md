> And again, by way of commandment to the church concerning the manner of baptism â€”All those who <u>humble</u>[^a] themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and <u>contrite spirits</u>[^b], and witness before the church that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the <u>name</u>[^c] of Jesus Christ, having a <u>determination</u>[^d] to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by their <u>works</u>[^e] that they have received of the <u>Spirit of Christ</u>[^f] unto the <u>remission</u>[^g] of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church.
