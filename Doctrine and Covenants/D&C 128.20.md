# D&C 128:20

> And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from <u>Cumorah</u>[^a] ! <u>Moroni</u>[^b], an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets—the <u>book</u>[^c] to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses to <u>bear record</u>[^d] of the book! The voice of <u>Michael</u>[^e] on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the <u>devil</u>[^f] when he appeared as an angel of <u>light</u>[^g] ! The voice of <u>Peter</u>[^h], James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the <u>keys</u>[^i] of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!
