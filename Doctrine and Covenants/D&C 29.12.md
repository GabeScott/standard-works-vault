# D&C 29:12

> And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine <u>apostles</u>[^a], the Twelve which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of <u>fire</u>[^b], being clothed with robes of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in <u>glory</u>[^c] even as I am, to <u>judge</u>[^d] the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept my commandments, and none else.
