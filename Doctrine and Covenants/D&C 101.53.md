# D&C 101:53

> Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and—after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a <u>watchman</u>[^a] upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?
