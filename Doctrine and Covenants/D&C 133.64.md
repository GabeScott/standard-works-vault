# D&C 133:64

> And also that which was written by the prophet <u>Malachi</u>[^a] : For, behold, the <u>day</u>[^b] cometh that shall <u>burn</u>[^c] as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do <u>wickedly</u>[^d], shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
