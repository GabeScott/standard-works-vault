# D&C 88:85

> That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the <u>desolation of abomination</u>[^a] which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the <u>first</u>[^b] elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall <u>call</u>[^c] them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not <u>clean</u>[^d] from the blood of this generation.
