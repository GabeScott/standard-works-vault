# D&C 71:1

> Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that the time has verily come that it is necessary and expedient in me that you should open your mouths in <u>proclaiming</u>[^a] my gospel, the things of the kingdom, expounding the <u>mysteries</u>[^b] thereof out of the scriptures, according to that portion of Spirit and power which shall be given unto you, even as I will.
