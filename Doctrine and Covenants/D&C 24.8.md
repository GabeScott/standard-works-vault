# D&C 24:8

> Be <u>patient</u>[^a] in <u>afflictions</u>[^b], for thou shalt have many; but <u>endure</u>[^c] them, for, lo, I am with thee, even unto the <u>end</u>[^d] of thy days.

[D&C 24:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.8?lang=eng#p8)
I am reading this verse as I feel very overwhelmed by work, church, and family responsibilities. It feels reassuring to know that it was always the plan for me to have many afflictions. It's not that I'm doing anything wrong (necessarily), or that I'm not the right person, or whatever. God wants me to have afflictions to teach me patience and how to rely on Him.
