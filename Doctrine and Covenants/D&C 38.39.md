# D&C 38:39

> And if ye seek the <u>riches</u>[^a] which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the <u>riches</u>[^b] of the earth are mine to give; but beware of <u>pride</u>[^c], lest ye become as the <u>Nephites</u>[^d] of old.
