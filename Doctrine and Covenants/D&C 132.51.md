# D&C 132:51

> Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to <u>prove</u>[^a] you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice.
