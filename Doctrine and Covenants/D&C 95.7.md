# D&C 95:7

> And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your <u>solemn assembly</u>[^a], that your <u>fastings</u>[^b] and your <u>mourning</u>[^c] might come up into the ears of the Lord of <u>Sabaoth</u>[^d], which is by interpretation, the <u>creator</u>[^e] of the first day, the beginning and the end.
