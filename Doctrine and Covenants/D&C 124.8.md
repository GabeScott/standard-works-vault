# D&C 124:8

> And that I may <u>visit</u>[^a] them in the day of visitation, when I shall <u>unveil</u>[^b] the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of the <u>oppressor</u>[^c] among hypocrites, where there is <u>gnashing</u>[^d] of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.
