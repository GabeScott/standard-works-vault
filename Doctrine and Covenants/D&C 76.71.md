# D&C 76:71

> And again, we saw the <u>terrestrial</u>[^a] world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the <u>Firstborn</u>[^b] who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the <u>moon</u>[^c] differs from the sun in the firmament.
