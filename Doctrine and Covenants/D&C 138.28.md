# D&C 138:28

> And I wondered at the words of Peter—wherein he said that the Son of God preached unto the <u>spirits</u>[^a] in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah—and how it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary labor among them in so short a time.
