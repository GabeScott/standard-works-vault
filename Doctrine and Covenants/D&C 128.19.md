# D&C 128:19

> Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of <u>gladness</u>[^a] ! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of <u>truth</u>[^b] out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great <u>joy</u>[^c] . How beautiful upon the mountains are the <u>feet</u>[^d] of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the <u>dews</u>[^e] of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!
