> And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his <u>portion</u>[^a], give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according to the <u>laws</u>[^b] and <u>covenants</u>[^c] of the church, to belong to the church.
