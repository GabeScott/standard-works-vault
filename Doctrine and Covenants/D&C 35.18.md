# D&C 35:18

> And I have given unto him the <u>keys</u>[^a] of the mystery of those things which have been <u>sealed</u>[^b], even things which were from the <u>foundation</u>[^c] of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he <u>abide</u>[^d] in me, and if not, <u>another</u>[^e] will I plant in his stead.
