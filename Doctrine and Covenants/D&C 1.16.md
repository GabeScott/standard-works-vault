# D&C 1:16

> They <u>seek</u>[^a] not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man <u>walketh</u>[^b] in his <u>own</u>[^c] <u>way</u>[^d], and after the <u>image</u>[^e] of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth <u>old</u>[^f] and shall perish in <u>Babylon</u>[^g], even Babylon the great, which shall fall.
