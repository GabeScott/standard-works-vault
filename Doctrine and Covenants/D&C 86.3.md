# D&C 86:3

> And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the <u>whore</u>[^a], even <u>Babylon</u>[^b], that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reignâ€”behold he soweth the <u>tares</u>[^c]; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the <u>church</u>[^d] into the wilderness.
