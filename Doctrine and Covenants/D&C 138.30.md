> But behold, from among the righteous, he <u>organized</u>[^a] his forces and appointed <u>messengers</u>[^b], <u>clothed</u>[^c] with power and authority, and <u>commissioned</u>[^d] them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in <u>darkness</u>[^e], even to <u>all</u>[^f] the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.
