# D&C 88:35

> That which <u>breaketh</u>[^a] a law, and <u>abideth not</u>[^b] by <u>law</u>[^c], but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, <u>justice</u>[^d], nor <u>judgment</u>[^e] . Therefore, they must remain <u>filthy</u>[^f] still.
