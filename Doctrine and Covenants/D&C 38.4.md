# D&C 38:4

> I am the same which have taken the <u>Zion</u>[^a] of <u>Enoch</u>[^b] into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have <u>believed</u>[^c] in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the <u>blood</u>[^d] which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.
