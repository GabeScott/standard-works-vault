# D&C 124:49

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their <u>diligence</u>[^a], and their enemies come upon them and <u>hinder</u>[^b] them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to <u>require</u>[^c] that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings.
