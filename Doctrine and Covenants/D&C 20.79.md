# D&C 20:79

> O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this <u>wine</u>[^a] to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.
