# D&C 123:7

> It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to angels, with whom we shall be brought to stand, and also to ourselves, to our wives and <u>children</u>[^a], who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow, and care, under the most damning hand of murder, tyranny, and <u>oppression</u>[^b], supported and urged on and upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath so strongly riveted the <u>creeds</u>[^c] of the fathers, who have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the children, and filled the world with confusion, and has been growing stronger and stronger, and is now the very mainspring of all corruption, and the whole <u>earth</u>[^d] groans under the weight of its iniquity.
