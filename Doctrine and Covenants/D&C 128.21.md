# D&C 128:21

> And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old <u>Father Whitmer</u>[^a], in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of <u>Gabriel</u>[^b], and of Raphael, and of divers <u>angels</u>[^c], from Michael or <u>Adam</u>[^d] down to the present time, all declaring their <u>dispensation</u>[^e], their rights, their <u>keys</u>[^f], their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, <u>precept</u>[^g] upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our <u>hope</u>[^h] !
