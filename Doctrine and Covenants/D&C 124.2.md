# D&C 124:2

> Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in answer to them I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to make a solemn <u>proclamation</u>[^a] of my gospel, and of this <u>stake</u>[^b] which I have planted to be a <u>cornerstone</u>[^c] of Zion, which shall be polished with the refinement which is after the similitude of a palace.
