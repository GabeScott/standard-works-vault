> Let my servant William Law also receive the keys by which he may ask and receive blessings; let him be <u>humble</u>[^a] before me, and be without <u>guile</u>[^b], and he shall receive of my Spirit, even the <u>Comforter</u>[^c], which shall manifest unto him the truth of all things, and shall give him, in the very hour, what he shall say.
