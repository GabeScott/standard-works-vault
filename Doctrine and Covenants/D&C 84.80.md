# D&C 84:80

> And any man that shall go and preach this <u>gospel</u>[^a] of the kingdom, and fail not to continue <u>faithful</u>[^b] in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a <u>hair</u>[^c] of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst.
