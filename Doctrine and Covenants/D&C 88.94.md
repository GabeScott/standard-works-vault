# D&C 88:94

> And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That <u>great</u>[^a] <u>church</u>[^b], the <u>mother</u>[^c] of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her <u>fornication</u>[^d], that <u>persecuteth</u>[^e] the saints of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea—behold, she is the <u>tares</u>[^f] of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.
