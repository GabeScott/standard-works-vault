# D&C 88:104

> And this shall be the sound of his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that are under the earth—for <u>every</u>[^a] ear shall hear it, and every knee shall <u>bow</u>[^b], and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the trump, saying: <u>Fear</u>[^c] God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne, <u>forever</u>[^d] and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come.
