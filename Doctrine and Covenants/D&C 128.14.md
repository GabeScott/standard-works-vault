# D&C 128:14

> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the <u>sealing</u>[^a] and binding power, and, in one sense of the word, the <u>keys</u>[^b] of the kingdom, which consist in the key of <u>knowledge</u>[^c] .
