# D&C 49:23

> Wherefore, be not <u>deceived</u>[^a], but continue in steadfastness, <u>looking</u>[^b] forth for the heavens to be <u>shaken</u>[^c], and the earth to tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the <u>valleys</u>[^d] to be exalted, and for the <u>mountains</u>[^e] to be made low, and for the rough places to become smooth—and all this when the angel shall sound his <u>trumpet</u>[^f] .
