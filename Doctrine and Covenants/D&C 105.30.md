# D&C 105:30

> And after these lands are purchased, I will hold the <u>armies</u>[^a] of Israel guiltless in taking possession of their own lands, which they have previously purchased with their moneys, and of throwing down the towers of mine enemies that may be upon them, and scattering their watchmen, and <u>avenging</u>[^b] me of mine enemies unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.
