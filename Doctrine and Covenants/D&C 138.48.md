> Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the <u>temples</u>[^a] of the Lord in the <u>dispensation</u>[^b] of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead, and the <u>sealing</u>[^c] of the children to their parents, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse and utterly wasted at his coming.
