> Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the <u>consecrated</u>[^a] land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.
