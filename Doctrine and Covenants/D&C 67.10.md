# D&C 67:10

> And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a <u>promise</u>[^a] I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you <u>strip</u>[^b] yourselves from <u>jealousies</u>[^c] and <u>fears</u>[^d], and <u>humble</u>[^e] yourselves before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the <u>veil</u>[^f] shall be rent and you shall <u>see</u>[^g] me and know that I amâ€”not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.
