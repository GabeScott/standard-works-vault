# D&C 122:6

> If thou art <u>accused</u>[^a] with all manner of false accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they tear thee from the society of thy father and mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder son, although but six years of age, shall cling to thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father, why canâ€™t you stay with us? O, my father, what are the men going to do with you? and if then he shall be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be dragged to <u>prison</u>[^b], and thine enemies prowl around thee like <u>wolves</u>[^c] for the blood of the lamb;
