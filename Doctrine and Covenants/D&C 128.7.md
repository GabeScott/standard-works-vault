# D&C 128:7

> You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the <u>records</u>[^a] which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the <u>book of life</u>[^b] is the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my placeâ€”that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.
