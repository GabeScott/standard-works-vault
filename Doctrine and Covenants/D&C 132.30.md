# D&C 132:30

> <u>Abraham</u>[^a] received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his loins—from whose <u>loins</u>[^b] ye are, namely, my servant Joseph—which were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham and his seed, out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the <u>stars</u>[^c]; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the seashore ye could not number them.
