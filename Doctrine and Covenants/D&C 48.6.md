> And they shall be appointed to <u>purchase</u>[^a] the lands, and to make a commencement to lay the foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be gathered with your families, every man according to his <u>family</u>[^b], according to his circumstances, and as is appointed to him by the presidency and the bishop of the church, according to the laws and commandments which ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
