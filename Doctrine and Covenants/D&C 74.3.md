# D&C 74:3

> And it came to pass that there arose a great <u>contention</u>[^a] among the people concerning the law of <u>circumcision</u>[^b], for the unbelieving husband was desirous that his children should be circumcised and become subject to the <u>law</u>[^c] of Moses, which law was fulfilled.
