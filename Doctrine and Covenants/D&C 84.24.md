# D&C 84:24

> But they <u>hardened</u>[^a] their hearts and could not endure his <u>presence</u>[^b]; therefore, the Lord in his <u>wrath</u>[^c], for his <u>anger</u>[^d] was kindled against them, swore that they should not <u>enter</u>[^e] into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.
