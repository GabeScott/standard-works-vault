# D&C 29:21

> And the great and <u>abominable</u>[^a] church, which is the <u>whore</u>[^b] of all the earth, shall be cast down by <u>devouring fire</u>[^c], according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely <u>must</u>[^d], as I live, for <u>abominations</u>[^e] shall not reign.
