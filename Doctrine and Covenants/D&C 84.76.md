# D&C 84:76

> But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given—from you it <u>must</u>[^a] be <u>preached</u>[^b] unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil <u>hearts</u>[^c] of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their <u>rebellion</u>[^d] against you at the time I sent you.
