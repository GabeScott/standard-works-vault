# D&C 122:4

> And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in <u>honor</u>[^a]; and but for a small <u>moment</u>[^b] and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce <u>lion</u>[^c], because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever.
