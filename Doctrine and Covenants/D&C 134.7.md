# D&C 134:7

> We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all <u>citizens</u>[^a] in the free exercise of their religious <u>belief</u>[^b]; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.
