# D&C 28:1

> Behold, I say unto thee, <u>Oliver</u>[^a], that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the <u>Comforter</u>[^b], concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given.

This is Oliver's calling in the Church at this time. He was called to preach and teach that which Joseph Smith received by revelation. God is a God of order and things in His house are done according to His order. Oliver was being reminded of that here even in how this section was received. Joseph Smith prayed to know what to do, the Lord revealed His will through Joseph to Oliver. From the first elder to the second elder.
