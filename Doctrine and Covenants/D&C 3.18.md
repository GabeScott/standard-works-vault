# D&C 3:18

> And this <u>testimony</u>[^a] shall come to the knowledge of the <u>Lamanites</u>[^b], and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who <u>dwindled</u>[^c] in unbelief because of the <u>iniquity</u>[^d] of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their <u>brethren</u>[^e] the Nephites, because of their <u>iniquities</u>[^f] and their abominations.
