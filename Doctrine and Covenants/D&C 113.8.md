# D&C 113:8

> He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should hold the <u>power</u>[^a] of <u>priesthood</u>[^b] to bring again <u>Zion</u>[^c], and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her <u>strength</u>[^d] is to put on the <u>authority</u>[^e] of the <u>priesthood</u>[^f], which she, Zion, has a <u>right</u>[^g] to by lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost.
