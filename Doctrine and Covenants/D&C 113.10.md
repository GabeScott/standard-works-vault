# D&C 113:10

> We are to understand that the <u>scattered</u>[^a] <u>remnants</u>[^b] are exhorted to <u>return</u>[^c] to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The <u>bands</u>[^d] of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.
