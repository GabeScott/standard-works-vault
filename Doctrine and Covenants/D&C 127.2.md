# D&C 127:2

> And as for the <u>perils</u>[^a] which I am called to pass through, they seem but a small thing to me, as the <u>envy</u>[^b] and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life; and for what cause it seems mysterious, unless I was <u>ordained</u>[^c] from before the foundation of the world for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for yourselves. God <u>knoweth</u>[^d] all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in <u>tribulation</u>[^e]; for to this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.
