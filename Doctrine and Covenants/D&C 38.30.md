# D&C 38:30

> I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, <u>treasure</u>[^a] up <u>wisdom</u>[^b] in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.
