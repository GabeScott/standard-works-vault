# D&C 65:2

> The <u>keys</u>[^a] of the <u>kingdom</u>[^b] of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the <u>gospel</u>[^c] roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the <u>stone</u>[^d] which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has <u>filled</u>[^e] the whole earth.
