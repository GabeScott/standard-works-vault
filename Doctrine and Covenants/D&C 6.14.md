# D&C 6:14

> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast <u>inquired</u>[^a] of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place where thou art at this time.
