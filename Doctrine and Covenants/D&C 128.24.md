# D&C 128:24

> Behold, the great <u>day</u>[^a] of the Lord is at hand; and who can <u>abide</u>[^b] the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a <u>refiner’s</u>[^c] <u>fire</u>[^d], and like fuller’s soap; and he shall sit as a <u>refiner</u>[^e] and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of <u>Levi</u>[^f], and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an <u>offering</u>[^g] in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the <u>records</u>[^h] of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.
