# D&C 121:33

> How long can rolling waters remain impure? What <u>power</u>[^a] shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to <u>hinder</u>[^b] the <u>Almighty</u>[^c] from pouring down <u>knowledge</u>[^d] from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.
