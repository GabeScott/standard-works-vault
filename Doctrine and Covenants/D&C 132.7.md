# D&C 132:7

> And verily I say unto you, that the <u>conditions</u>[^a] of this law are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, <u>oaths</u>[^b], <u>vows</u>[^c], performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and <u>sealed</u>[^d] by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is <u>anointed</u>[^e], both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by <u>revelation</u>[^f] and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this <u>power</u>[^g] (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this <u>power</u>[^h] in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the <u>keys</u>[^i] of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.
