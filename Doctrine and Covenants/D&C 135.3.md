# D&C 135:3

> Joseph Smith, the <u>Prophet</u>[^a] and <u>Seer</u>[^b] of the Lord, has done more, <u>save</u>[^c] Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the <u>fulness</u>[^d] of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lordâ€™s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own <u>blood</u>[^e]; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not <u>separated</u>[^f] !
