# D&C 24:12

> And at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and <u>declare</u>[^a] my gospel as with the voice of a <u>trump</u>[^b], both day and night. And I will give unto him strength such as is not known among men.

[D&C 24:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24.12?lang=eng#p12)
This is the verse that was using on my mission as our mission verse. We recited it at the beginning of zone conferences and the President talked about it a lot.
