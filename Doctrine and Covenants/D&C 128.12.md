# D&C 128:12

> Herein is <u>glory</u>[^a] and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance of baptism by water, to be <u>immersed</u>[^b] therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.
