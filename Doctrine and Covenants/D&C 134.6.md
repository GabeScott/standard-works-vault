# D&C 134:6

> We believe that every man should be <u>honored</u>[^a] in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the <u>laws</u>[^b] all men owe <u>respect</u>[^c] and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.
