# D&C 124:84

> And with my servant Almon Babbitt, there are many things with which I am not pleased; behold, he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a <u>golden</u>[^a] calf for the worship of my people.
