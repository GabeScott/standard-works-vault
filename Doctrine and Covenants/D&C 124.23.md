# D&C 124:23

> And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of all acceptation, that the weary <u>traveler</u>[^a] may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the <u>cornerstone</u>[^b] I have appointed for Zion.
