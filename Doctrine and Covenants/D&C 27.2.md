# D&C 27:2

> For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall <u>eat</u>[^a] or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my <u>glory</u>[^b] â€” <u>remembering</u>[^c] unto the Father my <u>body</u>[^d] which was laid down for you, and my <u>blood</u>[^e] which was shed for the <u>remission</u>[^f] of your sins.
