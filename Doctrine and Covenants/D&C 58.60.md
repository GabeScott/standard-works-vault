# D&C 58:60

> Let that which has been bestowed upon <u>Ziba Peterson</u>[^a] be taken from him; and let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands, with the brethren, until he is sufficiently <u>chastened</u>[^b] for all his sins; for he confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.
