# D&C 132:39

> <u>David’s</u>[^a] wives and concubines were <u>given</u>[^b] unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the <u>keys</u>[^c] of this power; and in none of these things did he <u>sin</u>[^d] against me save in the case of <u>Uriah</u>[^e] and his wife; and, therefore he hath <u>fallen</u>[^f] from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I <u>gave</u>[^g] them unto another, saith the Lord.
