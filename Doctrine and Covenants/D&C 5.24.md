# D&C 5:24

> Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and does not <u>humble</u>[^a] himself sufficiently before me; but if he will <u>bow</u>[^b] down before me, and humble himself in mighty <u>prayer</u>[^c] and faith, in the <u>sincerity</u>[^d] of his heart, then will I grant unto him a <u>view</u>[^e] of the things which he desires to see.
