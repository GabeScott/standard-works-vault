# D&C 127:4

> And again, verily thus saith the Lord: Let the work of my <u>temple</u>[^a], and all the works which I have appointed unto you, be continued on and not cease; and let your <u>diligence</u>[^b], and your perseverance, and patience, and your works be redoubled, and you shall in nowise lose your reward, saith the Lord of Hosts. And if they <u>persecute</u>[^c] you, so persecuted they the prophets and righteous men that were before you. For all this there is a reward in heaven.
