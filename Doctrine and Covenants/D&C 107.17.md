# D&C 107:17

> But as a high priest of the <u>Melchizedek Priesthood</u>[^a] has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of <u>bishop</u>[^b] when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and <u>set apart</u>[^c] and ordained unto this power by the hands of the <u>Presidency</u>[^d] of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
