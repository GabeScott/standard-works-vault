# D&C 33:1

> Behold, I say unto you, my servants <u>Ezra</u>[^a] and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose <u>word</u>[^b] is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and <u>intents</u>[^c] of the heart.
