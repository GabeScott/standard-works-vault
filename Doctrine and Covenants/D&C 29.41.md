> Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be <u>cast out</u>[^a] from the Garden of <u>Eden</u>[^b], from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became <u>spiritually</u>[^c] <u>dead</u>[^d], which is the first death, even that same death which is the last <u>death</u>[^e], which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye <u>cursed</u>[^f] .
