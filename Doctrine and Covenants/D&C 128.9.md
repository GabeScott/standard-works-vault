# D&C 128:9

> It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of—a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a <u>dispensation</u>[^a] of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in <u>authority</u>[^b], in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great <u>Jehovah</u>[^c] . This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it?
