# D&C 123:12

> For there are many yet on the earth among all sects, parties, and denominations, who are <u>blinded</u>[^a] by the subtle <u>craftiness</u>[^b] of men, whereby they lie in wait to <u>deceive</u>[^c], and who are only kept from the truth because they <u>know not</u>[^d] where to find it—
