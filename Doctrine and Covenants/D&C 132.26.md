# D&C 132:26

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the <u>Holy Spirit of promise</u>[^a], according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they <u>commit</u>[^b] no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be <u>delivered</u>[^c] unto the buffetings of <u>Satan</u>[^d] unto the day of <u>redemption</u>[^e], saith the Lord God.
