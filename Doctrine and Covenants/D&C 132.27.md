# D&C 132:27

> The <u>blasphemy</u>[^a] against the Holy Ghost, which shall <u>not</u>[^b] be <u>forgiven</u>[^c] in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit <u>murder</u>[^d] wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be <u>damned</u>[^e], saith the Lord.
