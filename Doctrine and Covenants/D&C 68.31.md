# D&C 68:31

> Now, I, the Lord, am not well <u>pleased</u>[^a] with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are <u>idlers</u>[^b] among them; and their <u>children</u>[^c] are also growing up in <u>wickedness</u>[^d]; they also <u>seek</u>[^e] not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of <u>greediness</u>[^f] .
