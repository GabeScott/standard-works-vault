# D&C 10:63

> And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much <u>contention</u>[^a]; yea, <u>Satan</u>[^b] doth <u>stir up</u>[^c] the hearts of the people to <u>contention</u>[^d] concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do <u>wrest</u>[^e] the scriptures and do not understand them.
