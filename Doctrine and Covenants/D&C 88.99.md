> And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who are Christ’s at his <u>coming</u>[^a]; who have received their part in that <u>prison</u>[^b] which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be <u>judged</u>[^c] according to men in the flesh.
