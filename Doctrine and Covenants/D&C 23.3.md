# D&C 23:3

> Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue <u>loosed</u>[^a]; and thy calling is to exhortation, and to <u>strengthen</u>[^b] the church continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family. Amen.
