# D&C 85:7

> And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in <u>order</u>[^a] the house of God, and to arrange by <u>lot</u>[^b] the <u>inheritances</u>[^c] of the saints whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God;
