# D&C 121:45

> Let thy <u>bowels</u>[^a] also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let <u>virtue</u>[^b] garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy <u>confidence</u>[^c] wax strong in the <u>presence</u>[^d] of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the <u>dews</u>[^e] from heaven.
