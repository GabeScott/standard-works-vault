# D&C 134:5

> We believe that all men are bound to <u>sustain</u>[^a] and uphold the respective <u>governments</u>[^b] in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and <u>rebellion</u>[^c] are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.
