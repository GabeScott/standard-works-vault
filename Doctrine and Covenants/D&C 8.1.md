# D&C 8:1

> <u>Oliver Cowdery</u>[^a], verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a <u>knowledge</u>[^b] of whatsoever things you shall <u>ask</u>[^c] in faith, with an <u>honest</u>[^d] heart, believing that you shall receive a <u>knowledge</u>[^e] concerning the engravings of old <u>records</u>[^f], which are ancient, which contain those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken by the <u>manifestation</u>[^g] of my Spirit.
