# D&C 20:26

> Not only those who believed after he came in the <u>meridian of time</u>[^a], in the <u>flesh</u>[^b], but all those from the beginning, even as many as were before he came, who believed in the words of the holy prophets, who <u>spake</u>[^c] as they were inspired by the <u>gift</u>[^d] of the Holy Ghost, who truly <u>testified</u>[^e] of him in all things, should have eternal life,
