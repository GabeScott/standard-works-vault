# D&C 3:4

> For although a man may have many <u>revelations</u>[^a], and have <u>power</u>[^b] to do many mighty works, yet if he <u>boasts</u>[^c] in his own <u>strength</u>[^d], and sets at naught the <u>counsels</u>[^e] of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and <u>carnal</u>[^f] desires, he must fall and incur the <u>vengeance</u>[^g] of a <u>just</u>[^h] God upon him.
