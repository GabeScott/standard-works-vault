# D&C 134:10

> We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their members for disorderly conduct, <u>according</u>[^a] to the rules and regulations of such societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but we do not believe that any religious society has <u>authority</u>[^b] to try men on the right of property or life, to take from them this worldâ€™s goods, or to put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw from them their fellowship.
