# D&C 134:8

> We believe that the commission of crime should be <u>punished</u>[^a] according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public <u>peace</u>[^b] and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing <u>offenders</u>[^c] against good laws to punishment.
