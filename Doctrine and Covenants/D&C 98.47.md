> But if the <u>children</u>[^a] shall repent, or the children’s children, and <u>turn</u>[^b] to the Lord their God, with all their hearts and with all their might, mind, and strength, and <u>restore</u>[^c] four-fold for all their trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their fathers’ fathers, then thine indignation shall be turned away;
