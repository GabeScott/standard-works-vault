# D&C 21:5

> For his <u>word</u>[^a] ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.

[D&C 21:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.5?lang=eng#p5)
## mine own mouth
- This is how we need to receive the commandments of God. The words we hear from the modern day prophets we should treat as if they came from God. We should be less concerned about when a prophet is talking in his "prophetic role" and when he isn't, and more concerned that we are striving to be obedient to the commandments of God.
- [[20250101abl - D&C 1.38]] - From mine own mouth or from the mouth of my prophets, it is the same
- [[20250102hit - 3 Nephi 1.13]] - God came to show the world that He will fulfill the words He spake from the mouth of His prophets.
