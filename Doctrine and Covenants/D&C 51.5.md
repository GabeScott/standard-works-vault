# D&C 51:5

> And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have power to <u>claim</u>[^a] that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall only have <u>claim</u>[^b] on that portion that is deeded unto him.
