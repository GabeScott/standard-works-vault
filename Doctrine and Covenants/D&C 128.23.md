# D&C 128:23

> Let the <u>mountains</u>[^a] shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid <u>rocks</u>[^b] weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the <u>morning</u>[^c] stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and <u>immortality</u>[^d], and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!
