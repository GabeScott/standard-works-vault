# D&C 124:21

> I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric, like unto my <u>servant</u>[^a] Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me.
