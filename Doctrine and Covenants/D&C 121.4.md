# D&C 121:4

> O Lord God <u>Almighty</u>[^a], maker of <u>heaven</u>[^b], earth, and seas, and of all things that in them are, and who controllest and subjectest the devil, and the dark and benighted dominion of Sheol—stretch forth thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy <u>pavilion</u>[^c] be taken up; let thy <u>hiding place</u>[^d] no longer be covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine <u>heart</u>[^e] be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion toward us.
