# D&C 19:40

> Or canst thou run about longer as a <u>blind</u>[^a] guide?

[D&C 19:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.40?lang=eng#p40)
This reminds me of the last verse of the hymn, "Israel, Israel, God is Calling":
How can we linger, or run about longer as a blind guide, after learning about the Savior and His Atonement? How can we after receiving joyful commandments from Him? 


[^a]: [[Matthew 23.16|Matt. 23:16 (16, 24)]].
