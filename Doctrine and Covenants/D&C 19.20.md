# D&C 19:20

> Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I <u>humble</u>[^a] you with my almighty power; and that you <u>confess</u>[^b] your sins, lest you suffer these <u>punishments</u>[^c] of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have <u>tasted</u>[^d] at the time I withdrew my Spirit.
