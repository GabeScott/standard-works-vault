# D&C 19:12

> Endless punishment is Godâ€™s punishment.

[D&C 19:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.12?lang=eng#p12)
I think the Lord is reiterating these statements to show that what He has said previously is still true and in force. His punishments are endless and eternal, but they don't last forever.
