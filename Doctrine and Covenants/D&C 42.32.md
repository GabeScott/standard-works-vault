> And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the <u>consecration</u>[^a] of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made <u>accountable</u>[^b] unto me, a <u>steward</u>[^c] over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and <u>family</u>[^d] .
