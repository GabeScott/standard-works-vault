# D&C 43:21

> For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye <u>hate</u>[^a] me, what will ye say when the <u>day</u>[^b] cometh when the <u>thunders</u>[^c] shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, sayingâ€”Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?
