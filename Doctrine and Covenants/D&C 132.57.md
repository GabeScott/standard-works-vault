# D&C 132:57

> And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for <u>Satan</u>[^a] <u>seeketh</u>[^b] to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his <u>exaltation</u>[^c] and glory.
