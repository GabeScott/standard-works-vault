# D&C 88:87

> For not many days hence and the <u>earth</u>[^a] shall <u>tremble</u>[^b] and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the <u>sun</u>[^c] shall <u>hide</u>[^d] his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in <u>blood</u>[^e]; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall <u>cast</u>[^f] themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig tree.
