# D&C 29:36

> And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the <u>devil</u>[^a] —for, behold, the <u>devil</u>[^b] was before Adam, for he <u>rebelled</u>[^c] against me, saying, Give me thine <u>honor</u>[^d], which is my <u>power</u>[^e]; and also a <u>third</u>[^f] part of the <u>hosts</u>[^g] of heaven turned he away from me because of their <u>agency</u>[^h];
