> I beheld that the faithful <u>elders</u>[^a] of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the <u>preaching</u>[^b] of the <u>gospel</u>[^c] of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the <u>spirits</u>[^d] of the dead.
