# D&C 134:3

> We believe that all governments necessarily require <u>civil</u>[^a] <u>officers</u>[^b] and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.
