# D&C 35:14

> And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their <u>shield</u>[^a] and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their <u>enemies</u>[^b] shall be under their feet; and I will let <u>fall</u>[^c] the <u>sword</u>[^d] in their behalf, and by the <u>fire</u>[^e] of mine indignation will I preserve them.
