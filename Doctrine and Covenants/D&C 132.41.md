# D&C 132:41

> And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man <u>receiveth</u>[^a] a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy <u>anointing</u>[^b], she hath committed <u>adultery</u>[^c] and shall be destroyed.
