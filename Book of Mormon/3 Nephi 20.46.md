# 3 Nephi 20:46

> Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled; and then shall <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a] be inhabited again with my people, and it shall be the land of their inheritance.
