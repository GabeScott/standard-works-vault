# Mosiah 4:30

> But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not <u>watch</u>[^a] yourselves, and your <u>thoughts</u>[^b], and your <u>words</u>[^c], and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and <u>continue</u>[^d] in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.
