# Alma 42:5

> For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and <u>partaken</u>[^a] of the <u>tree of life</u>[^b], he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.
