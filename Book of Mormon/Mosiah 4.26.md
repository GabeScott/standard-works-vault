# Mosiah 4:26

> And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you—that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may <u>walk</u>[^a] guiltless before God—I would that ye should <u>impart</u>[^b] of your substance to the <u>poor</u>[^c], every man according to that which he hath, such as <u>feeding</u>[^d] the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.
