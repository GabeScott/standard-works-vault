# Alma 19:5

> Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he <u>stinketh</u>[^a], and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.
