# 3 Nephi 1:19

> And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be <u>born</u>[^a], because of the <u>sign</u>[^b] which had been given.
