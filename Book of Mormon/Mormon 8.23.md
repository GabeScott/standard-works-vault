# Mormon 8:23

> Search the prophecies of <u>Isaiah</u>[^a] . Behold, I cannot write them. Yea, behold I say unto you, that those saints who have gone before me, who have possessed this land, shall <u>cry</u>[^b], yea, even from the dust will they cry unto the Lord; and as the Lord liveth he will remember the covenant which he hath made with them.
