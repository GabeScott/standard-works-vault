# Mosiah 29:40

> And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a <u>tyrant</u>[^a] who was seeking for gain, yea, for that <u>lucre</u>[^b] which doth <u>corrupt</u>[^c] the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established <u>peace</u>[^d] in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.
