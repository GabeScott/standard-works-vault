# Mosiah 27:18

> And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an <u>angel</u>[^a] of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which <u>shook</u>[^b] the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.
