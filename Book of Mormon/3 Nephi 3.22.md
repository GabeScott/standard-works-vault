# 3 Nephi 3:22

> And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their <u>horses</u>[^a], and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the <u>place</u>[^b] which <u>had</u>[^c] been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.
