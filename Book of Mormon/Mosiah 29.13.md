# Mosiah 29:13

> Therefore, <u>if</u>[^a] it were possible that you could have <u>just</u>[^b] men to be your kings, who would establish the <u>laws</u>[^c] of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father <u>Benjamin</u>[^d] did for this peopleâ€”I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.
