# 2 Nephi 25:20

> And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that <u>brought</u>[^a] Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should <u>heal</u>[^b] the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the <u>serpent</u>[^c] which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the <u>rock</u>[^d] and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are <u>true</u>[^e], and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other <u>name</u>[^f] given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
