# Helaman 3:35

> Nevertheless they did <u>fast</u>[^a] and <u>pray</u>[^b] oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their <u>humility</u>[^c], and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the <u>purifying</u>[^d] and the <u>sanctification</u>[^e] of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their <u>yielding</u>[^f] their hearts unto God.
