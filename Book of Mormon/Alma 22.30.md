# Alma 22:30

> And it bordered upon the land which they called <u>Desolation</u>[^a], it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose <u>bones</u>[^b] we have spoken, which was discovered by the <u>people</u>[^c] of Zarahemla, it being the place of their <u>first</u>[^d] landing.
