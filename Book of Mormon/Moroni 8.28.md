# Moroni 8:28

> Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath <u>ceased</u>[^a] <u>striving</u>[^b] with them; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are <u>denying</u>[^c] the Holy Ghost.
