# Alma 13:3

> And this is the manner after which they were ordainedâ€”being <u>called</u>[^a] and <u>prepared</u>[^b] from the <u>foundation</u>[^c] of the world according to the <u>foreknowledge</u>[^d] of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to <u>choose</u>[^e] good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great <u>faith</u>[^f], are <u>called</u>[^g] with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.
