# Mosiah 10:5

> And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and <u>cloth</u>[^a] of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the landâ€”thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.
