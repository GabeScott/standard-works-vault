# Ether 13:2

> For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the waters had <u>receded</u>[^a] from off the face of this <u>land</u>[^b] it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should <u>serve</u>[^c] him who dwell upon the face thereof;
