# Mormon 8:5

> Behold, my father hath made <u>this record</u>[^a], and he hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I would write it also if I had room upon the <u>plates</u>[^b], but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone. My father hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and <u>how</u>[^c] long the Lord will suffer that I may live I know not.
