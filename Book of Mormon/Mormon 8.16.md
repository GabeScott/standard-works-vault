> And blessed be <u>he</u>[^a] that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be <u>brought</u>[^b] out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.
