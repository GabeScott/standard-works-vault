# Alma 50:25

> And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a <u>contention</u>[^a] which took place among them concerning the land of <u>Lehi</u>[^b], and the land of <u>Morianton</u>[^c], which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.
