# Jacob 4:5

> Behold, they believed in Christ and <u>worshiped</u>[^a] the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his <u>name</u>[^b] . And for this intent we <u>keep</u>[^c] the <u>law</u>[^d] of Moses, it <u>pointing</u>[^e] our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a <u>similitude</u>[^f] of God and his <u>Only Begotten Son</u>[^g] .
