# Alma 34:36

> And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in <u>unholy</u>[^a] temples, but in the <u>hearts</u>[^b] of the <u>righteous</u>[^c] doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the <u>blood</u>[^d] of the Lamb.
