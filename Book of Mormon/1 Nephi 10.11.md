# 1 Nephi 10:11

> And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be preached among the Jews, and also concerning the <u>dwindling</u>[^a] of the Jews in <u>unbelief</u>[^b] . And after they had <u>slain</u>[^c] the Messiah, who should come, and after he had been slain he should <u>rise</u>[^d] from the dead, and should make himself <u>manifest</u>[^e], by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.
