# 2 Nephi 9:25

> Wherefore, he has given a <u>law</u>[^a]; and where there is <u>no</u>[^b] <u>law</u>[^c] given there is no <u>punishment</u>[^d]; and where there is no punishment there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.
