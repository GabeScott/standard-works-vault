# Omni 1:26

> And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should <u>come</u>[^a] unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and <u>offer</u>[^b] your whole souls as an <u>offering</u>[^c] unto him, and continue in <u>fasting</u>[^d] and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.
