# Alma 10:17

> Now they knew not that Amulek could <u>know</u>[^a] of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he <u>perceived</u>[^b] their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse <u>generation</u>[^c], ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying <u>traps</u>[^d] and snares to catch the holy ones of God.
