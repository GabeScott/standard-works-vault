# Mosiah 29:20

> But behold, he did deliver them because they did <u>humble</u>[^a] themselves before him; and because they <u>cried</u>[^b] mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of <u>mercy</u>[^c] towards them that put their <u>trust</u>[^d] in him.
