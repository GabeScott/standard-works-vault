# Ether 5:1

> And now I, Moroni, have written the words which were commanded me, according to my memory; and I have told you the things which I have <u>sealed</u>[^a] up; therefore touch them not in order that ye may translate; for that thing is forbidden you, except by and by it shall be wisdom in God.
