# 1 Nephi 17:55

> And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is <u>with thee</u>[^a], for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has shaken us. And they fell down before me, and were about to <u>worship</u>[^b] me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy <u>days</u>[^c] may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
