# Mosiah 2:27

> Therefore, as I said unto you that I had <u>served</u>[^a] you, <u>walking</u>[^b] with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your <u>blood</u>[^c] should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.
