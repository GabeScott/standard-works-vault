# Alma 14:23

> And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of <u>Ammonihah</u>[^a] and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.
