# Moroni 6:4

> And after they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and <u>cleansed</u>[^a] by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the <u>church</u>[^b] of Christ; and their <u>names</u>[^c] were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually <u>watchful</u>[^d] unto prayer, <u>relying</u>[^e] alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.
