# 2 Nephi 25:6

> But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which <u>hath</u>[^a] come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.
