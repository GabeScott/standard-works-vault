# Helaman 11:17

> And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that <u>rain</u>[^a] should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.
