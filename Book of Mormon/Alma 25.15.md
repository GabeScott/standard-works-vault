# Alma 25:15

> Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But notwithstanding the <u>law</u>[^a] of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a <u>type</u>[^b] of his coming, and believing that they must keep those <u>outward</u>[^c] <u>performances</u>[^d] until the time that he should be revealed unto them.
