# Alma 61:9

> And now, in your epistle you have <u>censured</u>[^a] me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not <u>seek</u>[^b] for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us <u>free</u>[^c] .
