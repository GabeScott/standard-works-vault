# Alma 32:13

> And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh <u>repentance</u>[^a]; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and <u>endureth</u>[^b] to the end the same shall be saved.
