# Jacob 5:75

> And it came to pass that when the <u>Lord</u>[^a] of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning. And <u>blessed</u>[^b] art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the <u>natural</u>[^c] fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have <u>joy</u>[^d] with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.
