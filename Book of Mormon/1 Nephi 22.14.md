# 1 Nephi 22:14

> And every <u>nation</u>[^a] which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall <u>fall</u>[^b] into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that <u>fight</u>[^c] against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the <u>dust</u>[^d] and great shall be the fall of it.
