# Alma 45:16

> And he said: Thus saith the Lord Godâ€” <u>Cursed</u>[^a] shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do <u>wickedly</u>[^b], when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the <u>blessing</u>[^c] of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the <u>least</u>[^d] degree of allowance.
