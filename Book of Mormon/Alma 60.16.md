# Alma 60:16

> Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out <u>among</u>[^a] ourselves; yea, were it not for these <u>king-men</u>[^b], who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among ourselves, if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would have been done, according to the <u>fulfilling</u>[^c] of his word.
