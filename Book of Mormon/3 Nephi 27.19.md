# 3 Nephi 27:19

> And <u>no unclean thing</u>[^a] can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his <u>rest</u>[^b] save it be those who have <u>washed</u>[^c] their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.
