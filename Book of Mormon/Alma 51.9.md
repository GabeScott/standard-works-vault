# Alma 51:9

> But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again <u>stirred up</u>[^a] the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had <u>sworn</u>[^b] to drink the blood of Moroni.
