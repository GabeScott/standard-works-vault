# Ether 15:15

> And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and their children—both men, women and children being armed with <u>weapons</u>[^a] of war, having shields, and <u>breastplates</u>[^b], and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war—they did march forth one against another to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not.
