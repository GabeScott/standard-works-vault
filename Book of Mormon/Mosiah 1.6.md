# Mosiah 1:6

> O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are <u>true</u>[^a] . And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.
