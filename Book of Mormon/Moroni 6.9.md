# Moroni 6:9

> And their meetings were <u>conducted</u>[^a] by the church after the manner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the <u>power</u>[^b] of the Holy Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.
