# Jacob 5:42

> Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become <u>corrupted</u>[^a] . And now these which have once brought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be <u>hewn</u>[^b] down and cast into the fire.
