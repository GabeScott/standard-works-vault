# Alma 35:15

> Now Alma, being <u>grieved</u>[^a] for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they began to be <u>offended</u>[^b] because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.
