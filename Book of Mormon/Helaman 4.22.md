# Helaman 4:22

> And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the <u>laws</u>[^a] of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.
