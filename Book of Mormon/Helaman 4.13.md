# Helaman 4:13

> And because of this their great wickedness, and their <u>boastings</u>[^a] in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.
