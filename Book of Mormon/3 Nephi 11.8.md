# 3 Nephi 11:8

> And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they <u>saw</u>[^a] a Man <u>descending</u>[^b] out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.
