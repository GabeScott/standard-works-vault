# 3 Nephi 3:12

> Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a <u>robber</u>[^a]; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for <u>strength</u>[^b] against the time that the robbers should come down against them.
