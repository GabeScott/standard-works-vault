# Mosiah 3:25

> And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful <u>view</u>[^a] of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of <u>misery</u>[^b] and <u>endless</u>[^c] torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.
