# Mormon 2:26

> And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did <u>beat</u>[^a] them; nevertheless the <u>strength</u>[^b] of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.
