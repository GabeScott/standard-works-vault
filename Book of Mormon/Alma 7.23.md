# Alma 7:23

> And now I would that ye should be <u>humble</u>[^a], and be <u>submissive</u>[^b] and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.
