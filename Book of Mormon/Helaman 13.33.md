# Helaman 13:33

> O <u>that</u>[^a] I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and <u>stoned</u>[^b] them, and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.
