# Mormon 2:18

> And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon <u>these plates</u>[^a] I did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.
