# 2 Nephi 11:3

> And my brother, Jacob, also has <u>seen</u>[^a] him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of <u>three</u>[^b], God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more <u>witnesses</u>[^c], and he proveth all his words.
