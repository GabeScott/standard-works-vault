# Alma 3:14

> Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be <u>separated</u>[^a] from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and <u>turn</u>[^b] to me that I may have mercy upon them.
