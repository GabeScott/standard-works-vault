# Mosiah 4:1

> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the <u>angel</u>[^a] of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had <u>fallen</u>[^b] to the earth, for the <u>fear</u>[^c] of the Lord had come upon them.
