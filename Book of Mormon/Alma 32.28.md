# Alma 32:28

> Now, we will compare the word unto a <u>seed</u>[^a] . Now, if ye give place, that a <u>seed</u>[^b] may be planted in your <u>heart</u>[^c], behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your <u>unbelief</u>[^d], that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselvesâ€”It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to <u>enlighten</u>[^e] my <u>understanding</u>[^f], yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.
