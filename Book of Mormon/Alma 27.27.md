# Alma 27:27

> And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their <u>zeal</u>[^a] towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly <u>honest</u>[^b] and upright in all things; and they were <u>firm</u>[^c] in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.
