# Alma 32:42

> And because of your <u>diligence</u>[^a] and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the <u>fruit</u>[^b] thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.
