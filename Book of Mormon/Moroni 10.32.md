# Moroni 10:32

> Yea, <u>come</u>[^a] unto Christ, and be <u>perfected</u>[^b] in him, and <u>deny</u>[^c] yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and <u>love</u>[^d] God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be <u>perfect</u>[^e] in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
