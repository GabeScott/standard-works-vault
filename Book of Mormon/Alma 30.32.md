# Alma 30:32

> Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have <u>labored</u>[^a] even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine <u>own</u>[^b] hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.
