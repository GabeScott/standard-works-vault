> Yea, and after having been <u>delivered</u>[^a] of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been <u>saved</u>[^b] from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of <u>bondage</u>[^c] time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of thingsâ€”
