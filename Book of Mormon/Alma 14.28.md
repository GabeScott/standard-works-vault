# Alma 14:28

> And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them <u>power</u>[^a], according to their faith which was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were <u>loosed</u>[^b] from their <u>bands</u>[^c]; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.
