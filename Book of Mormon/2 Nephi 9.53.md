# 2 Nephi 9:53

> And behold how great the <u>covenants</u>[^a] of the Lord, and how great his <u>condescensions</u>[^b] unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his <u>grace</u>[^c] and <u>mercy</u>[^d], he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would <u>preserve</u>[^e] them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous <u>branch</u>[^f] unto the house of Israel.
