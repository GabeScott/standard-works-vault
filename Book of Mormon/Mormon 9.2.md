# Mormon 9:2

> Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation—behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that <u>great day</u>[^a] when the <u>earth</u>[^b] shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall <u>melt</u>[^c] with fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God—then will ye say that there is no God?
