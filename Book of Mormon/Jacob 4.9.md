# Jacob 4:9

> For behold, by the power of his <u>word</u>[^a] <u>man</u>[^b] came upon the face of the earth, which earth was <u>created</u>[^c] by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the <u>earth</u>[^d], or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?
