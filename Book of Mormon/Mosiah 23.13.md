# Mosiah 23:13

> And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the <u>hands</u>[^a] of king Noah and his people, and also from the <u>bonds</u>[^b] of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should <u>stand fast</u>[^c] in this <u>liberty</u>[^d] wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust <u>no man</u>[^e] to be a king over you.
