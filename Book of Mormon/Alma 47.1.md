# Alma 47:1

> Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had <u>fled</u>[^a] with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the <u>land of Nephi</u>[^b] among the Lamanites, and did <u>stir up</u>[^c] the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.
