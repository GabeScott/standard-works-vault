# 2 Nephi 33:10

> And now, my beloved brethren, and also <u>Jew</u>[^a], and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and <u>believe</u>[^b] in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall <u>believe</u>[^c] in Christ ye will believe in these <u>words</u>[^d], for they are the <u>words</u>[^e] of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they <u>teach</u>[^f] all men that they should do good.
