# 2 Nephi 27:22

> Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the <u>witnesses</u>[^a] which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own <u>wisdom</u>[^b] to <u>reveal</u>[^c] all things unto the children of men.
