# 1 Nephi 19:23

> And I did read many things unto them which were written in the <u>books</u>[^a] of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet <u>Isaiah</u>[^b]; for I did <u>liken</u>[^c] all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our <u>profit</u>[^d] and learning.
