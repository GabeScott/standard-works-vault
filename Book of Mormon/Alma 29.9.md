# Alma 29:9

> I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do <u>not</u>[^a] <u>glory</u>[^b] of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.
