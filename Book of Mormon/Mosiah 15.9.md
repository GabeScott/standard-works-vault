# Mosiah 15:9

> Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon <u>himself</u>[^a] their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and <u>satisfied</u>[^b] the demands of justice.
