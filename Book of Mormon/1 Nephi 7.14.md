# 1 Nephi 7:14

> For behold, the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of the Lord <u>ceaseth</u>[^b] soon to strive with them; for behold, they have <u>rejected</u>[^c] the prophets, and <u>Jeremiah</u>[^d] have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the <u>life</u>[^e] of my father, insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.
