# Helaman 2:8

> And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his <u>object</u>[^a] to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their <u>secret</u>[^b] plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.
