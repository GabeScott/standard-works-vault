# Alma 22:32

> And now, it was only the <u>distance</u>[^a] of a day and a halfâ€™s journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water, there being a small <u>neck</u>[^b] of land between the land northward and the land southward.
