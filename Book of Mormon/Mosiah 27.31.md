# Mosiah 27:31

> Yea, <u>every</u>[^a] knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be <u>judged</u>[^b] of him, then shall they confess that he is <u>God</u>[^c]; then shall they confess, who live <u>without</u>[^d] God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his <u>all-searching</u>[^e] eye.
