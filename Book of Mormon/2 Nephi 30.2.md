# 2 Nephi 30:2

> For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the <u>covenant</u>[^a] people of the Lord; and as many of the <u>Jews</u>[^b] as will not repent shall be <u>cast off</u>[^c]; for the Lord <u>covenanteth</u>[^d] with none save it be with them that <u>repent</u>[^e] and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.
