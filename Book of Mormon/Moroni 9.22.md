# Moroni 9:22

> But behold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I <u>pray</u>[^a] unto God that he will <u>spare</u>[^b] thy life, to witness the return of his people unto him, or their utter destruction; for I know that they must perish except they <u>repent</u>[^c] and return unto him.
