# 2 Nephi 25:29

> And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and <u>worship</u>[^a] him with all your <u>might</u>[^b], mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.
