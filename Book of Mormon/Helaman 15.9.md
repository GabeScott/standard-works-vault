# Helaman 15:9

> And ye know also that they have <u>buried</u>[^a] their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sinâ€”for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their <u>faith</u>[^b] in Christ.
