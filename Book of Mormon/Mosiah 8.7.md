# Mosiah 8:7

> And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that <u>forty</u>[^a] and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.
