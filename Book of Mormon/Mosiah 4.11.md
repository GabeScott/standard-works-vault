# Mosiah 4:11

> And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have <u>tasted</u>[^a] of his love, and have received a <u>remission</u>[^b] of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own <u>nothingness</u>[^c], and his <u>goodness</u>[^d] and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of <u>humility</u>[^e], <u>calling</u>[^f] on the name of the Lord daily, and standing <u>steadfastly</u>[^g] in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.
