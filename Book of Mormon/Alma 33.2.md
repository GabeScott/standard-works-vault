# Alma 33:2

> And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye <u>could</u>[^a] not <u>worship</u>[^b] your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the <u>scriptures</u>[^c]; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.
