# 1 Nephi 1:14

> And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy <u>power</u>[^a], and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who <u>come</u>[^b] unto thee that they shall perish!
