# Ether 15:19

> But behold, the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and <u>Satan</u>[^b] had full power over the <u>hearts</u>[^c] of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.
