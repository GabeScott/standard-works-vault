# 3 Nephi 27:11

> But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are <u>hewn</u>[^a] down and cast into the <u>fire</u>[^b], from whence there is no return.
