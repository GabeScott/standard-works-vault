# Alma 56:56

> But behold, to my great joy, there had <u>not</u>[^a] one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the <u>strength</u>[^b] of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.
