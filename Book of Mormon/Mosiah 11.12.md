# Mosiah 11:12

> And it came to pass that he built a <u>tower</u>[^a] near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of <u>Shilom</u>[^b], and also the land of <u>Shemlon</u>[^c], which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.
