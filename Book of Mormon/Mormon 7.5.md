# Mormon 7:5

> Know ye that ye must come to the <u>knowledge</u>[^a] of your fathers, and repent of all your sins and iniquities, and <u>believe</u>[^b] in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath gained the <u>victory</u>[^c] over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up.
