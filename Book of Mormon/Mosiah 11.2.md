# Mosiah 11:2

> For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and <u>concubines</u>[^a] . And he did <u>cause</u>[^b] his people to commit sin, and do that which was <u>abominable</u>[^c] in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit <u>whoredoms</u>[^d] and <u>all</u>[^e] manner of wickedness.
