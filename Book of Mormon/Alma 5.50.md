# Alma 5:50

> Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his <u>glory</u>[^a], in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the <u>King</u>[^b] of all the earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men.
