# 2 Nephi 6:12

> And blessed are the <u>Gentiles</u>[^a], they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and <u>abominable</u>[^b] church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his <u>covenants</u>[^c] which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.
