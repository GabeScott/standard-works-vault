# 2 Nephi 25:16

> And after they have been <u>scattered</u>[^a], and the Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be persuaded to <u>believe</u>[^b] in Christ, the Son of God, and the atonement, which is infinite for all mankind—and when that day shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with pure hearts and <u>clean hands</u>[^c], and look not forward any more for <u>another</u>[^d] Messiah, then, at that time, the day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should believe these things.
