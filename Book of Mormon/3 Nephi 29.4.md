# 3 Nephi 29:4

> And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the <u>sword</u>[^a] of his <u>justice</u>[^b] is in his right hand; and behold, at that day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.
