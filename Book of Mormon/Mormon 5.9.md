# Mormon 5:9

> And also that a knowledge of these things must <u>come</u>[^a] unto the remnant of these people, and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath said should <u>scatter</u>[^b] this people, and this people should be counted as naught among them—therefore <u>I</u>[^c] write a <u>small abridgment</u>[^d], daring not to give a full account of the things which I have seen, because of the commandment which I have received, and also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this people.
