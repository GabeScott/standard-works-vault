# Mosiah 7:13

> For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a <u>descendant</u>[^a] of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the <u>land of Zarahemla</u>[^b] to inquire concerning our brethren, whom <u>Zeniff</u>[^c] brought up out of that land.
