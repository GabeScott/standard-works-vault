# Alma 42:13

> Therefore, according to justice, the <u>plan</u>[^a] of <u>redemption</u>[^b] could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would <u>cease</u>[^c] to be God.
