# 2 Nephi 25:18

> Wherefore, he shall bring forth <u>his</u>[^a] <u>words</u>[^b] unto them, which words shall <u>judge</u>[^c] them at the last day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of <u>convincing</u>[^d] them of the true Messiah, who was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there should not any come, save it should be a <u>false Messiah</u>[^e] which should deceive the people; for there is save one <u>Messiah</u>[^f] spoken of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected of the Jews.
