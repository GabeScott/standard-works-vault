# Alma 14:10

> And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the <u>power</u>[^a] of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.
