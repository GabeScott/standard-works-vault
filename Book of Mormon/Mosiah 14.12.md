# Mosiah 14:12

> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the <u>great</u>[^a], and <u>he</u>[^b] shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made <u>intercession</u>[^c] for the transgressors.
