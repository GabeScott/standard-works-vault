# 1 Nephi 3:29

> And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an <u>angel</u>[^a] of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a <u>ruler</u>[^b] over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will <u>deliver</u>[^c] Laban into your hands.
