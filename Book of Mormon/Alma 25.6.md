# Alma 25:6

> For many of <u>them</u>[^a], after having suffered much loss and so many afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the <u>words</u>[^b] which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to disbelieve the <u>traditions</u>[^c] of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness.
