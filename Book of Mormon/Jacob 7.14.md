# Jacob 7:14

> And I said unto him: What am I that I should <u>tempt</u>[^a] God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be <u>true</u>[^b] ? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the <u>devil</u>[^c] . Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a <u>sign</u>[^d] unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.
