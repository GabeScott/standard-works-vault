# 2 Nephi 31:19

> And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow <u>path</u>[^a], I would ask if all is <u>done</u>[^b] ? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken <u>faith</u>[^c] in him, <u>relying</u>[^d] wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to <u>save</u>[^e] .
