# Alma 40:13

> And then shall it come to pass, that the <u>spirits</u>[^a] of the wicked, yea, who are evil—for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the <u>devil</u>[^b] did enter into them, and take possession of their house—and these shall be cast out into <u>outer darkness</u>[^c]; there shall be <u>weeping</u>[^d], and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.
