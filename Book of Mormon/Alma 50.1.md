# Alma 50:1

> And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up <u>heaps</u>[^a] of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.
