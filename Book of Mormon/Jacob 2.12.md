# Jacob 2:12

> And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of precious <u>ores</u>[^a], in the which this land, which is a <u>land of promise</u>[^b] unto you and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully.
