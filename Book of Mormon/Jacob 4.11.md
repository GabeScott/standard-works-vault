> Wherefore, beloved brethren, be <u>reconciled</u>[^a] unto him through the <u>atonement</u>[^b] of Christ, his <u>Only Begotten Son</u>[^c], and ye may obtain a <u>resurrection</u>[^d], according to the <u>power</u>[^e] of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the <u>first-fruits</u>[^f] of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.
