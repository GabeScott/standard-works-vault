# Alma 1:4

> And he also testified unto the people that <u>all</u>[^a] mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they <u>need</u>[^b] not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had <u>created</u>[^c] all men, and had also <u>redeemed</u>[^d] <u>all</u>[^e] men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.
