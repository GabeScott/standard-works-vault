# Alma 46:24

> Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a <u>part</u>[^b] of the <u>remnant</u>[^c] of the coat of Joseph was <u>preserved</u>[^d] and had not decayed. And he said—Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a <u>remnant</u>[^e] of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.
