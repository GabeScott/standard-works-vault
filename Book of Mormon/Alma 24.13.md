# Alma 24:13

> Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords <u>again</u>[^a] they can no more be <u>washed</u>[^b] bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.
