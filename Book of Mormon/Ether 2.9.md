# Ether 2:9

> And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be <u>swept off</u>[^a] when the fulness of his <u>wrath</u>[^b] shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are <u>ripened</u>[^c] in iniquity.
