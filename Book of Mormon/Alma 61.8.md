# Alma 61:8

> They have <u>got</u>[^a] possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a <u>king</u>[^b] over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered <u>under</u>[^c] the Lamanites.
