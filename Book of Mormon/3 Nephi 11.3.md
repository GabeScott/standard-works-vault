# 3 Nephi 11:3

> And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a <u>voice</u>[^a] as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a <u>small</u>[^b] voice it did <u>pierce</u>[^c] them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.
