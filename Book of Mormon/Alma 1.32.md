# Alma 1:32

> For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in <u>sorceries</u>[^a], and in <u>idolatry</u>[^b] or <u>idleness</u>[^c], and in <u>babblings</u>[^d], and in <u>envyings</u>[^e] and <u>strife</u>[^f]; wearing costly apparel; being <u>lifted up</u>[^g] in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.
