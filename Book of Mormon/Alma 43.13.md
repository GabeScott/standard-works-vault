# Alma 43:13

> And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to <u>support</u>[^a] their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the <u>descendants</u>[^b] of the priests of Noah.
