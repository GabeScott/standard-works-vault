# Alma 17:36

> But <u>Ammon</u>[^a] stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a <u>certain</u>[^b] number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they <u>could</u>[^c] not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.
