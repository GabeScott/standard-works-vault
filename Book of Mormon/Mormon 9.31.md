# Mormon 9:31

> Condemn me not because of mine <u>imperfection</u>[^a], neither my father, because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.
