# 3 Nephi 3:24

> And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land <u>southward</u>[^a], because of the great curse which was upon the <u>land</u>[^b] northward.
