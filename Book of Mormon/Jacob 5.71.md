# Jacob 5:71

> And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and <u>labor</u>[^a] in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the <u>last time</u>[^b] that I shall <u>nourish</u>[^c] my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.
