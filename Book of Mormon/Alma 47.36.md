# Alma 47:36

> Now these <u>dissenters</u>[^a], having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same <u>knowledge</u>[^b] of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and <u>impenitent</u>[^c], and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites—drinking in with the <u>traditions</u>[^d] of the Lamanites; giving way to <u>indolence</u>[^e], and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God.
