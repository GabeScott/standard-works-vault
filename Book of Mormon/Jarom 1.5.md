# Jarom 1:5

> And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land. They observed to <u>keep</u>[^a] the law of Moses and the <u>sabbath</u>[^b] day holy unto the Lord. And they <u>profaned</u>[^c] not; neither did they <u>blaspheme</u>[^d] . And the <u>laws</u>[^e] of the land were exceedingly strict.
