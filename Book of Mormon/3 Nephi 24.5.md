# 3 Nephi 24:5

> And I will come <u>near</u>[^a] to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the <u>sorcerers</u>[^b], and against the adulterers, and against false <u>swearers</u>[^c], and against those that <u>oppress</u>[^d] the hireling in his wages, the widow and the <u>fatherless</u>[^e], and that turn aside the <u>stranger</u>[^f], and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.
