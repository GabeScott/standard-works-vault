# Mormon 8:14

> And I am the same who <u>hideth</u>[^a] up this record unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them <u>to</u>[^b] get gain; but the record thereof is of <u>great</u>[^c] worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.
