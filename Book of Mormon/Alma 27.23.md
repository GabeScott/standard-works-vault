# Alma 27:23

> And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may <u>protect</u>[^a] our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful wickedness.
