# Alma 33:23

> And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall <u>plant</u>[^a] this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And behold, it will become a tree, <u>springing up</u>[^b] in you unto <u>everlasting life</u>[^c] . And then may God grant unto you that your <u>burdens</u>[^d] may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye <u>will</u>[^e] . Amen.
