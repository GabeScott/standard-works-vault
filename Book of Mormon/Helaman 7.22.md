# Helaman 7:22

> And for this cause <u>wo</u>[^a] shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this <u>great</u>[^b] city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you <u>strength</u>[^c], as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.
