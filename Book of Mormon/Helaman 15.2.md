# Helaman 15:2

> Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall be no place for <u>refuge</u>[^a]; yea, and wo unto them which are <u>with</u>[^b] child, for they shall be heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.
