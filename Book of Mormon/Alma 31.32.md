# Alma 31:32

> O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are with me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also <u>Amulek</u>[^a] and Zeezrom, and also my <u>two</u>[^b] sons—yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.
