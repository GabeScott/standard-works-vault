# Helaman 1:22

> And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart <u>took courage</u>[^a] insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.
