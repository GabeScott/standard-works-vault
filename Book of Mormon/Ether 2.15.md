# Ether 2:15

> And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my <u>Spirit</u>[^a] will not always <u>strive</u>[^b] with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these are my <u>thoughts</u>[^c] upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land <u>choice</u>[^d] above all other lands.
