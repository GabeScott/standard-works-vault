# Mosiah 17:2

> But there was one among them whose name was <u>Alma</u>[^a], he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he <u>believed</u>[^b] the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.
