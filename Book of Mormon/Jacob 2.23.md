# Jacob 2:23

> But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing <u>whoredoms</u>[^a], because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.
