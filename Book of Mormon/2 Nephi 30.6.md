# 2 Nephi 30:6

> And then shall they rejoice; for they shall <u>know</u>[^a] that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their <u>scales</u>[^b] of darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a pure and a <u>delightsome</u>[^c] people.
