# Alma 22:27

> And it came to pass that the king sent a <u>proclamation</u>[^a] throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the <u>west</u>[^b], and which was divided from the land of <u>Zarahemla</u>[^c] by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of <u>Manti</u>[^d], by the head of the <u>river Sidon</u>[^e], running from the east towards the westâ€”and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided.
