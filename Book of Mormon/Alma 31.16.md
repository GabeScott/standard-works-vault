# Alma 31:16

> Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast <u>elected</u>[^a] us to be thy <u>holy</u>[^b] children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that <u>there</u>[^c] shall be <u>no</u>[^d] Christ.
