# Enos 1:27

> And I soon go to the place of my <u>rest</u>[^a], which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall <u>rest</u>[^b] . And I rejoice in the day when my <u>mortal</u>[^c] shall put on <u>immortality</u>[^d], and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the <u>mansions</u>[^e] of my Father. Amen.
