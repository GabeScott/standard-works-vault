# 1 Nephi 17:30

> And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, <u>leading</u>[^a] them by day and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were <u>expedient</u>[^b] for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded their minds, and <u>reviled</u>[^c] against Moses and against the true and living God.
