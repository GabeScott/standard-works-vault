# 1 Nephi 22:6

> Nevertheless, after they shall be <u>nursed</u>[^a] by the <u>Gentiles</u>[^b], and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and their <u>children</u>[^c] have been carried in their arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders, behold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the house of Israel.
