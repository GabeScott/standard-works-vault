# Alma 49:17

> And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had <u>sworn</u>[^a] with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.
