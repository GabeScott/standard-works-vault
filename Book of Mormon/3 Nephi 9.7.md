# 3 Nephi 9:7

> Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a] and the inhabitants thereof; and <u>waters</u>[^b] have I caused to come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the <u>blood</u>[^c] of the prophets and the saints shall <u>not come up</u>[^d] any more unto me against them.
