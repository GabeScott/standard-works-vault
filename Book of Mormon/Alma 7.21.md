# Alma 7:21

> And he doth not dwell in <u>unholy</u>[^a] temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is <u>filthy</u>[^b] shall remain in his filthiness.
