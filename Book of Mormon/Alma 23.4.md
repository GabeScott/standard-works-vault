# Alma 23:4

> And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from <u>city to city</u>[^a], and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating <u>priests</u>[^b] and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.
