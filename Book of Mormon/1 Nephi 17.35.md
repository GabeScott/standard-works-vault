# 1 Nephi 17:35

> Behold, the Lord esteemeth all <u>flesh</u>[^a] in one; he that is <u>righteous</u>[^b] is <u>favored</u>[^c] of God. But behold, this <u>people</u>[^d] had rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it.
