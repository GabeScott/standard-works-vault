# 1 Nephi 22:1

> And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the <u>plates of brass</u>[^a], my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What <u>meaneth</u>[^b] these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are <u>spiritual</u>[^c], which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh?
