# Jacob 3:11

> O my brethren, hearken unto my words; <u>arouse</u>[^a] the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may <u>awake</u>[^b] from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of <u>hell</u>[^c] that ye may not become <u>angels</u>[^d] to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second <u>death</u>[^e] .
