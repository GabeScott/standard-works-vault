# Mosiah 13:5

> Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face <u>shone</u>[^a] with exceeding luster, even as Mosesâ€™ did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking with the Lord.
