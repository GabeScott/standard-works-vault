# Moroni 10:31

> And <u>awake</u>[^a], and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of <u>Zion</u>[^b]; and <u>strengthen</u>[^c] thy <u>stakes</u>[^d] and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest <u>no more</u>[^e] be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.
