# Alma 13:23

> And they are made known unto us in <u>plain</u>[^a] terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being <u>wanderers</u>[^b] in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.
