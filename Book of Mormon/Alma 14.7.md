# Alma 14:7

> And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am <u>guilty</u>[^a], and these men are spotless before God. And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and <u>cast</u>[^b] him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.
