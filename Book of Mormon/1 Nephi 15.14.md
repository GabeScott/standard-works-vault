> And at that day shall the remnant of our <u>seed</u>[^a] <u>know</u>[^b] that they are of the house of Israel, and that they are the <u>covenant</u>[^c] people of the Lord; and then shall they know and <u>come</u>[^d] to the <u>knowledge</u>[^e] of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be saved.
