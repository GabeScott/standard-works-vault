# 2 Nephi 26:6

> And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the <u>fire</u>[^a] of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
