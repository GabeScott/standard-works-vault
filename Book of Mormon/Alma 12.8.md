# Alma 12:8

> And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the <u>just</u>[^a] and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be <u>judged</u>[^b] according to their works?
