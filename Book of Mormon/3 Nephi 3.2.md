# 3 Nephi 3:2

> Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in <u>maintaining</u>[^a] that which ye suppose to be your right and <u>liberty</u>[^b]; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.
