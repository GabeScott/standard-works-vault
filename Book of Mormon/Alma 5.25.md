# Alma 5:25

> I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the <u>children</u>[^a] of the kingdom of the devil.
