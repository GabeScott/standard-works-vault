# Alma 5:39

> And now if ye are not the <u>sheep</u>[^a] of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the <u>devil</u>[^b] is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a <u>liar</u>[^c] and a <u>child</u>[^d] of the devil.
