> Therefore, <u>Helaman</u>[^a] and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint <u>priests</u>[^b] and <u>teachers</u>[^c] throughout all the land, over all the churches.
