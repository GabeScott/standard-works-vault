# Alma 9:12

> Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all—he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly <u>destroy</u>[^a] you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his <u>anger</u>[^b], and in his <u>fierce</u>[^c] anger he will not turn away.
