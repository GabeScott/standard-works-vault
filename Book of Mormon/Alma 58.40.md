# Alma 58:40

> But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they <u>stand fast</u>[^a] in that <u>liberty</u>[^b] wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come.
