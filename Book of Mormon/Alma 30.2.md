# Alma 30:2

> Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numberedâ€”but it came to pass after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of <u>fasting</u>[^a], and <u>mourning</u>[^b], and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout all the land.
