# Mosiah 22:1

> And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should <u>deliver</u>[^a] themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.
