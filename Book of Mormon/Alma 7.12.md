> And he will take upon him <u>death</u>[^a], that he may <u>loose</u>[^b] the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to <u>succor</u>[^c] his people according to their infirmities.
