# Alma 48:16

> And also, that God would make it known unto them <u>whither</u>[^a] they should go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it; <u>not</u>[^b] in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.
