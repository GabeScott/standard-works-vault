# Ether 15:16

> And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling and a <u>lamentation</u>[^a] for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air exceedingly.
