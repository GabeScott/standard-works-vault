# Mosiah 21:26

> Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry <u>bones</u>[^a]; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the <u>coming</u>[^b] of Ammon.
