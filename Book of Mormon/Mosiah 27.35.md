> And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the <u>people</u>[^a] who were under the reign of king Mosiah, <u>zealously</u>[^b] striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, <u>confessing</u>[^c] all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.
