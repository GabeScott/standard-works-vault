# 1 Nephi 16:2

> And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken <u>hard things</u>[^a] against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the <u>guilty</u>[^b] taketh the <u>truth</u>[^c] to be hard, for it <u>cutteth</u>[^d] them to the very center.
