# 3 Nephi 3:19

> Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the <u>spirit</u>[^a] of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.
