# Helaman 10:4

> <u>Blessed</u>[^a] art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with <u>unwearyingness</u>[^b] declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine <u>own life</u>[^c], but hast sought my <u>will</u>[^d], and to keep my commandments.
