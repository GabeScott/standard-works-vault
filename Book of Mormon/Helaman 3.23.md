# Helaman 3:23

> And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the <u>secret combinations</u>[^a] which <u>Gadianton</u>[^b] the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.
