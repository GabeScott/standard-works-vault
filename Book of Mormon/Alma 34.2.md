# Alma 34:2

> My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that <u>these things</u>[^a] were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.
