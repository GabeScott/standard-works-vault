# Mormon 7:10

> And ye will also know that ye are a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first covenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized, first <u>with water</u>[^b], then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the <u>example</u>[^c] of our Savior, according to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.
