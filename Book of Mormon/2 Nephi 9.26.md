# 2 Nephi 9:26

> For the <u>atonement</u>[^a] satisfieth the demands of his <u>justice</u>[^b] upon all those who <u>have</u>[^c] not the <u>law</u>[^d] given to them, that they are <u>delivered</u>[^e] from that awful monster, death and <u>hell</u>[^f], and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them <u>breath</u>[^g], which is the Holy One of Israel.
