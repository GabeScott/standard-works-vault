# Ether 3:19

> And because of the <u>knowledge</u>[^a] of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the <u>veil</u>[^b]; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had <u>faith</u>[^c] no longer, for he knew, nothing <u>doubting</u>[^d] .
