# 2 Nephi 9:51

> Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your <u>labor</u>[^a] for that which cannot <u>satisfy</u>[^b] . Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and <u>feast</u>[^c] upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.
