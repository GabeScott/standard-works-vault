# 1 Nephi 18:11

> And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and <u>bind</u>[^a] me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had <u>spoken</u>[^b] concerning the wicked.
