# Mosiah 26:38

> And now all these things did Alma and his <u>fellow laborers</u>[^a] do who were over the church, <u>walking</u>[^b] in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.
