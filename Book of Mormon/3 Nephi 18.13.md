# 3 Nephi 18:13

> But whoso among you shall do <u>more</u>[^a] or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall <u>fall</u>[^b], and the <u>gates</u>[^c] of hell are ready open to receive them.
