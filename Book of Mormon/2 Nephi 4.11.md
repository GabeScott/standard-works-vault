# 2 Nephi 4:11

> And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy <u>seed</u>[^a]; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.
