# Alma 26:24

> For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the <u>incorrectness</u>[^a] of the <u>traditions</u>[^b] of their fathers, as <u>stiffnecked</u>[^c] a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the <u>shedding</u>[^d] of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.
