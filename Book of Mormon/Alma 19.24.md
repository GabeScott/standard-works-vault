# Alma 19:24

> And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, <u>fear</u>[^a] came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this great power, or what all these things could mean.
