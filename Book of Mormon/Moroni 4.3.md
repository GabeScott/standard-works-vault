> O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and <u>sanctify</u>[^a] this <u>bread</u>[^b] to the souls of all those who partake of it; that they may eat in <u>remembrance</u>[^c] of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the <u>name</u>[^d] of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his <u>Spirit</u>[^e] to be with them. Amen.
