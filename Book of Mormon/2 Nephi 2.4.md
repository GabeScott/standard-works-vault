# 2 Nephi 2:4

> And thou hast <u>beheld</u>[^a] in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and <u>salvation</u>[^b] is <u>free</u>[^c] .
