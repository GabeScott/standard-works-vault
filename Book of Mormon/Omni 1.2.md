# Omni 1:2

> Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites, from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But behold, I of myself <u>am</u>[^a] a wicked man, and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.
