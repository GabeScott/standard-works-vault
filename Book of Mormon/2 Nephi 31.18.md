# 2 Nephi 31:18

> And then are ye in this <u>strait</u>[^a] and narrow <u>path</u>[^b] which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which <u>witnesses</u>[^c] of the <u>Father</u>[^d] and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
