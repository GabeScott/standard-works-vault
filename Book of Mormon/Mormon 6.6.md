# Mormon 6:6

> And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our people in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were <u>sacred</u>[^a], to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would <u>destroy</u>[^b] them) therefore I made <u>this record</u>[^c] out of the plates of Nephi, and <u>hid</u>[^d] up in the hill Cumorah all the records which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were <u>these</u>[^e] few plates which I gave unto my son <u>Moroni</u>[^f] .
