# Alma 22:14

> And since man had <u>fallen</u>[^a] he could not <u>merit</u>[^b] anything of himself; but the sufferings and <u>death</u>[^c] of Christ <u>atone</u>[^d] for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the <u>grave</u>[^e] shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.
