# 3 Nephi 6:15

> Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this— <u>Satan</u>[^a] had great <u>power</u>[^b], unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and <u>riches</u>[^c], and the vain things of the world.
