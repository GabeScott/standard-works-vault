# Mormon 9:29

> See that ye are not baptized <u>unworthily</u>[^a]; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ <u>unworthily</u>[^b]; but see that ye do all things in <u>worthiness</u>[^c], and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out.
