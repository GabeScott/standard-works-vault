# Mormon 5:15

> And also that the seed of <u>this people</u>[^a] may more fully believe his gospel, which shall <u>go forth</u>[^b] unto them from the Gentiles; for this people shall be <u>scattered</u>[^c], and shall <u>become</u>[^d] a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath been among the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry.
