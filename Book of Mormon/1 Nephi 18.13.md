# 1 Nephi 18:13

> Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great <u>storm</u>[^a], yea, a great and terrible tempest, and we were <u>driven</u>[^b] back upon the waters for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not loose me.
