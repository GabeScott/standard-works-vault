# Mormon 8:28

> Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be <u>denied</u>[^a], and <u>churches</u>[^b] become defiled and be <u>lifted up</u>[^c] in the pride of their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches.
