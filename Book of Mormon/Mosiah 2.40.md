# Mosiah 2:40

> O, all ye <u>old</u>[^a] men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a <u>remembrance</u>[^b] of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.
