# Alma 60:9

> But behold, this is not allâ€”ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to <u>perish</u>[^a] with hunger, because of your exceedingly great neglect towards them.
