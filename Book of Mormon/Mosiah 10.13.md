# Mosiah 10:13

> And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their <u>first</u>[^a] inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lordâ€”therefore <u>he</u>[^b] was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.
