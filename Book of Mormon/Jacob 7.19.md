# Jacob 7:19

> And he said: I <u>fear</u>[^a] lest I have committed the <u>unpardonable sin</u>[^b], for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be <u>awful</u>[^c]; but I confess unto God.
