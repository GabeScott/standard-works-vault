# Mormon 9:13

> And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the <u>presence</u>[^a] of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the <u>resurrection</u>[^b], which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless <u>sleep</u>[^c], from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal <u>band</u>[^d] of death, which death is a temporal death.
