# 2 Nephi 2:26

> And the <u>Messiah</u>[^a] cometh in the fulness of time, that he may <u>redeem</u>[^b] the children of men from the fall. And because that they are <u>redeemed</u>[^c] from the fall they have become <u>free</u>[^d] forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the <u>law</u>[^e] at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
