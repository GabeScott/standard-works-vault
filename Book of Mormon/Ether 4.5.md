# Ether 4:5

> Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have written them. And he commanded me that I should <u>seal</u>[^a] them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the <u>interpreters</u>[^b], according to the commandment of the Lord.
