# 2 Nephi 3:17

> And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will <u>write</u>[^a] unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a <u>spokesman</u>[^b] for him.
