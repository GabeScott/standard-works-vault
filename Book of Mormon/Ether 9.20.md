# Ether 9:20

> And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was <u>choice</u>[^a] above all other lands; and he commanded that whoso should possess the land should possess it unto the Lord, or they should be <u>destroyed</u>[^b] when they were ripened in iniquity; for upon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath.
