# Mormon 2:17

> And now, the city of Jashon was near the <u>land</u>[^a] where Ammaron had <u>deposited</u>[^b] the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the <u>plates of Nephi</u>[^c], and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron.
