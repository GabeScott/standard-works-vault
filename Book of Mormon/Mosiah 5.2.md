# Mosiah 5:2

> And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty <u>change</u>[^a] in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do <u>evil</u>[^b], but to do good continually.
