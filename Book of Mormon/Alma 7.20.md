# Alma 7:20

> I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot <u>walk</u>[^a] in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.
