# Alma 5:7

> Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the <u>bands</u>[^a] of death, and the <u>chains</u>[^b] of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.
