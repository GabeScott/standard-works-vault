# Alma 7:15

> Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth <u>beset</u>[^a] you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.
