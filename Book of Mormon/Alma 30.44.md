# Alma 30:44

> But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of <u>all</u>[^a] these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the <u>earth</u>[^b], and <u>all</u>[^c] things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its <u>motion</u>[^d], yea, and also all the <u>planets</u>[^e] which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.
