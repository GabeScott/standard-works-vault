# Alma 22:31

> And they came from there <u>up</u>[^a] into the south wilderness. Thus the <u>land</u>[^b] on the northward was called <u>Desolation</u>[^c], and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.
