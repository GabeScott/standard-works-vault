# Helaman 8:24

> And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many <u>evidences</u>[^a] which ye have received; yea, even ye have received <u>all</u>[^b] things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.
