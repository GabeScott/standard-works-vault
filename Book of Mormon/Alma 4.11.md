# Alma 4:11

> And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the <u>example</u>[^a] of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.
