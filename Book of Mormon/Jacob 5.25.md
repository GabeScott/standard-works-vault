# Jacob 5:25

> And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a <u>good</u>[^a] spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a <u>part</u>[^b] of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the <u>other</u>[^c] part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.
