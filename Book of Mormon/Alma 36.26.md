# Alma 36:26

> For because of the <u>word</u>[^a] which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have <u>tasted</u>[^b] as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.
