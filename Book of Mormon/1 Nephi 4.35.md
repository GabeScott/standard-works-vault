# 1 Nephi 4:35

> And it came to pass that <u>Zoram</u>[^a] did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth.
