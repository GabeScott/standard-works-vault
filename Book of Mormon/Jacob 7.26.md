# Jacob 7:26

> And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the <u>other plates</u>[^a] of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our <u>lives</u>[^b] passed away like as it were unto us a <u>dream</u>[^c], we being a <u>lonesome</u>[^d] and a solemn people, <u>wanderers</u>[^e], cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.
