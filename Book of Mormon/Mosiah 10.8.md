# Mosiah 10:8

> And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men <u>armed</u>[^a] with <u>bows</u>[^b], and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.
