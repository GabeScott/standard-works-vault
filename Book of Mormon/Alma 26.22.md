# Alma 26:22

> Yea, he that <u>repenteth</u>[^a] and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good <u>works</u>[^b], and prayeth continually without ceasing—unto such it is given to know the <u>mysteries</u>[^c] of God; yea, unto such it shall be <u>given</u>[^d] to <u>reveal</u>[^e] things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.
