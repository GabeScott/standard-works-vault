# Alma 46:13

> And he fastened on his head-plate, and his <u>breastplate</u>[^a], and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the <u>title of liberty</u>[^b] ) and he <u>bowed</u>[^c] himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of <u>Christians</u>[^d] remain to possess the landâ€”
