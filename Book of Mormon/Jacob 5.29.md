# Jacob 5:29

> And it came to pass that a <u>long</u>[^a] time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his <u>servant</u>[^b] : Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard. For behold, the time draweth near, and the <u>end</u>[^c] soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.
