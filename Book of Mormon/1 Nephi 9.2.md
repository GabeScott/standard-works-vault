# 1 Nephi 9:2

> And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the <u>plates</u>[^a] upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.

[^a]: IE the full account is on larger plates; the special account of his ministry is on the smaller plates of Nephi. See Jacob 3:13-14. See also 1 Ne. 1:17 (16-17); 6:1; 10:1; 19:2, 4; [[Omni 1.1|Omni 1:1]]; W of M 1:3 (2-11); [[D&C 10.38|D&C 10:38 (38-40).]]
