# 1 Nephi 9:2

> And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the <u>plates</u>[^a] upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
