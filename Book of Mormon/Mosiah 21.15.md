# Mosiah 21:15

> And now the Lord was <u>slow</u>[^a] to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their <u>cries</u>[^b], and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.
