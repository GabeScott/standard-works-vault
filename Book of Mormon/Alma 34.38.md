# Alma 34:38

> That ye <u>contend</u>[^a] no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the <u>name</u>[^b] of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and <u>worship</u>[^c] God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in <u>thanksgiving</u>[^d] daily, for the many <u>mercies</u>[^e] and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.
