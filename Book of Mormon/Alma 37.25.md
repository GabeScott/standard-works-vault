# Alma 37:25

> I will <u>bring forth</u>[^a] out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will <u>destroy</u>[^b] them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.
