# Alma 43:30

> And he also knowing that it was the <u>only</u>[^a] desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and their <u>liberty</u>[^b], and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by <u>stratagem</u>[^c]; therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take.
