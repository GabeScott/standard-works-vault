# 3 Nephi 19:25

> And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his <u>countenance</u>[^a] did smile upon them, and the light of his <u>countenance</u>[^b] did <u>shine</u>[^c] upon them, and behold they were as <u>white</u>[^d] as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.
