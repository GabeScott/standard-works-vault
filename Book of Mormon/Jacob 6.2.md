# Jacob 6:2

> And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to <u>recover</u>[^a] his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the <u>servants</u>[^b] of the Lord shall go forth in his <u>power</u>[^c], to <u>nourish</u>[^d] and prune his <u>vineyard</u>[^e]; and after that the <u>end</u>[^f] soon cometh.
