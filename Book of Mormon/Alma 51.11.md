# Alma 51:11

> Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who had been <u>slain</u>[^a] by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla.
