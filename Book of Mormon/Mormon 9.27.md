# Mormon 9:27

> O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. <u>Doubt</u>[^a] not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and <u>come</u>[^b] unto the Lord with all your <u>heart</u>[^c], and <u>work</u>[^d] out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.
