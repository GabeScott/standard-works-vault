# Mosiah 1:5

> I say unto you, my sons, <u>were</u>[^a] it not for these things, which have been kept and <u>preserved</u>[^b] by the hand of God, that we might <u>read</u>[^c] and understand of his <u>mysteries</u>[^d], and have his <u>commandments</u>[^e] always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the <u>traditions</u>[^f] of their fathers, which are not correct.
