# Jacob 5:8

> And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take <u>away</u>[^a] many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them <u>whithersoever</u>[^b] I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.
