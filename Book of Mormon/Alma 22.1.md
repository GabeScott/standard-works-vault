# Alma 22:1

> Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was <u>led</u>[^a] by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was <u>over</u>[^b] all the land <u>save</u>[^c] it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.
