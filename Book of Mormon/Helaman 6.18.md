# Helaman 6:18

> And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and <u>Gadianton</u>[^a] . And now it had come to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s band. But behold, they were more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called Gadianton’s robbers and murderers.
