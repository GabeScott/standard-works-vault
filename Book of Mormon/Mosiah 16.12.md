# Mosiah 16:12

> Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would <u>not</u>[^a]; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.
