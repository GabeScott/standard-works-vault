# Alma 53:2

> And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man <u>like</u>[^a] unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each otherâ€™s safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.
