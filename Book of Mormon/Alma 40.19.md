# Alma 40:19

> Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass <u>before</u>[^a] the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.
