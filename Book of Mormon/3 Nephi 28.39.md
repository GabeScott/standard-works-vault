# 3 Nephi 28:39

> Now this change was not equal to that which shall take place at the last day; but there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could not <u>tempt</u>[^a] them; and they were <u>sanctified</u>[^b] in the flesh, that they were <u>holy</u>[^c], and that the powers of the earth could not hold them.
