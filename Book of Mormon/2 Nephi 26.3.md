# 2 Nephi 26:3

> And after the Messiah shall come there shall be <u>signs</u>[^a] given unto my people of his <u>birth</u>[^b], and also of his <u>death</u>[^c] and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the <u>prophets</u>[^d], and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the <u>blood</u>[^e] of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.
