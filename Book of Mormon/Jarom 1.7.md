# Jarom 1:7

> And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites, to battle. But our <u>kings</u>[^a] and our <u>leaders</u>[^b] were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of <u>our</u>[^c] lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.
