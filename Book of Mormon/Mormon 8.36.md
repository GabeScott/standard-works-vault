# Mormon 8:36

> And I know that ye do <u>walk</u>[^a] in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not <u>lift</u>[^b] themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of <u>very fine apparel</u>[^c], unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.
