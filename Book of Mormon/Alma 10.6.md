# Alma 10:6

> Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was <u>called</u>[^a] many times and I would not <u>hear</u>[^b]; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling <u>against</u>[^c] God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.
