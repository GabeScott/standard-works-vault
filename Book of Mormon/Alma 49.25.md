# Alma 49:25

> And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a <u>Nephite</u>[^a] by birth, concerning their great <u>loss</u>[^b] .
