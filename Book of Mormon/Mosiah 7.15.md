# Mosiah 7:15

> For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are <u>taxed</u>[^a] with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our <u>bondage</u>[^b], or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their <u>slaves</u>[^c]; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
