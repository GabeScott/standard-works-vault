# 3 Nephi 19:4

> And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was gathered together, behold, Nephi and his <u>brother</u>[^a] whom he had raised from the <u>dead</u>[^b], whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah—now these were the <u>names</u>[^c] of the <u>disciples</u>[^d] whom Jesus had chosen—and it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.
