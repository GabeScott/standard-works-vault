# Alma 47:13

> And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehontiâ€™s hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second <u>leader</u>[^a] over the whole army.
