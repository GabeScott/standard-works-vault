# Alma 11:20

> Now, it was for the sole purpose to get <u>gain</u>[^a], because they received their wages according to their <u>employ</u>[^b], therefore, they did <u>stir up</u>[^c] the people to <u>riotings</u>[^d], and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might <u>get</u>[^e] <u>money</u>[^f] according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.
