# 2 Nephi 28:8

> And there shall also be many which shall say: <u>Eat</u>[^a], drink, and be <u>merry</u>[^b]; nevertheless, fear Godâ€”he will <u>justify</u>[^c] in committing a little <u>sin</u>[^d]; yea, <u>lie</u>[^e] a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a <u>pit</u>[^f] for thy neighbor; there is <u>no</u>[^g] harm in this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
