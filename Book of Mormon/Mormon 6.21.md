# Mormon 6:21

> And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become <u>incorruptible</u>[^a] bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.
