# 4 Nephi 1:46

> And it came to pass that the robbers of <u>Gadianton</u>[^a] did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did <u>traffic</u>[^b] in all manner of traffic.
