# Jacob 4:13

> Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] speaketh the <u>truth</u>[^b] and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really <u>are</u>[^c], and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us <u>plainly</u>[^d], for the salvation of our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also <u>spake</u>[^e] them unto prophets of old.
