# Mosiah 16:1

> And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come when all shall see the <u>salvation</u>[^a] of the Lord; when <u>every</u>[^b] nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall <u>confess</u>[^c] before God that his <u>judgments</u>[^d] are just.
