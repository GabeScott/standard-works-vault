# Omni 1:13

> And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had commanded him. And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings. And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by the power of his <u>arm</u>[^a], through the wilderness until they came down into the land which is called the <u>land of Zarahemla</u>[^b] .
