# 3 Nephi 9:20

> And ye shall offer for a <u>sacrifice</u>[^a] unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I <u>baptize</u>[^b] with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.
