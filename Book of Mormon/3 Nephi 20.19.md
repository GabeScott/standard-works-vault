# 3 Nephi 20:19

> For I will make my <u>people</u>[^a] with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy <u>horn</u>[^b] iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt <u>beat</u>[^c] in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth it.
