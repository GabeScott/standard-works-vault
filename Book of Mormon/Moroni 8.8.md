# Moroni 8:8

> <u>Listen</u>[^a] to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the <u>whole</u>[^b] need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little <u>children</u>[^c] are <u>whole</u>[^d], for they are not capable of committing <u>sin</u>[^e]; wherefore the curse of <u>Adam</u>[^f] is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of <u>circumcision</u>[^g] is done away in me.
