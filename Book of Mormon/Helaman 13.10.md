# Helaman 13:10

> Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the <u>fourth</u>[^a] generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.
