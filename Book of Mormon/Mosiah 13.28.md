# Mosiah 13:28

> And moreover, I say unto you, that <u>salvation</u>[^a] doth not come by the <u>law</u>[^b] alone; and were it not for the <u>atonement</u>[^c], which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.
