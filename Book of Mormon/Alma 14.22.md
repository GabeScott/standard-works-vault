# Alma 14:22

> And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did <u>mock</u>[^a] them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were <u>bound</u>[^b] with strong cords, and confined in <u>prison</u>[^c] .
