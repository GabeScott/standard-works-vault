# Alma 31:38

> And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of <u>afflictions</u>[^a], save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in <u>faith</u>[^b] .
