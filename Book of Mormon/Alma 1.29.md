# Alma 1:29

> And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly <u>rich</u>[^a], having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need—an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of <u>silk</u>[^b] and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely <u>cloth</u>[^c] .
