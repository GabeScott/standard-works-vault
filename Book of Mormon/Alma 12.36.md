# Alma 12:36

> And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity <u>provoketh</u>[^a] him that he sendeth down his <u>wrath</u>[^b] upon you as in the <u>first</u>[^c] provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting <u>destruction</u>[^d] of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.
