# Helaman 11:8

> And the people <u>began</u>[^a] to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our <u>destruction</u>[^b] be fulfilled.
