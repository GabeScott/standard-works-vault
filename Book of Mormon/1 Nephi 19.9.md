# 1 Nephi 19:9

> And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they <u>spit</u>[^a] upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving <u>kindness</u>[^b] and his <u>long-suffering</u>[^c] towards the children of men.
