# Ether 10:13

> And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great age, and then he begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and he did reign eight years, and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did <u>not</u>[^a] reign in righteousness, wherefore he was not favored of the Lord.
