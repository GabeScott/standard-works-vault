# 3 Nephi 16:8

> But wo, saith the Father, unto the <u>unbelieving</u>[^a] of the Gentilesâ€”for notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face of this land, and have <u>scattered</u>[^b] my people who are of the house of Israel; and my people who are of the house of Israel have been <u>cast out</u>[^c] from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them;
