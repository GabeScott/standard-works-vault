# Mosiah 21:30

> And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the <u>death</u>[^a] of Abinadi; and also for the <u>departure</u>[^b] of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.
