# Alma 10:23

> But it is by the <u>prayers</u>[^a] of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will <u>cast out</u>[^b] the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the <u>time</u>[^c] is soon at hand except ye repent.
