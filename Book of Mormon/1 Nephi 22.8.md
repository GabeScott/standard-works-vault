# 1 Nephi 22:8

> And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a <u>marvelous work</u>[^a] among the <u>Gentiles</u>[^b], which shall be of great <u>worth</u>[^c] unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the <u>Gentiles</u>[^d] and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders.
