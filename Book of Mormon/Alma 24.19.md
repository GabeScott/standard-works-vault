# Alma 24:19

> And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to <u>believe</u>[^a] and to know the truth, they were <u>firm</u>[^b], and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.
