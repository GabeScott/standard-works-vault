# Mosiah 18:13

> And when he had said these words, the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having <u>authority</u>[^b] from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a <u>covenant</u>[^c] to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the <u>foundation</u>[^d] of the world.
