# Ether 10:5

> And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and <u>concubines</u>[^a], and did lay that upon menâ€™s shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did <u>tax</u>[^b] them with heavy taxes; and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.
