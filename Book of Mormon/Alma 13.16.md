# Alma 13:16

> Now these <u>ordinances</u>[^a] were given after this <u>manner</u>[^b], that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a <u>type</u>[^c] of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.
