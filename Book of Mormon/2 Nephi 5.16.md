# 2 Nephi 5:16

> And I, Nephi, did <u>build</u>[^a] a <u>temple</u>[^b]; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of <u>Solomon</u>[^c] save it were not built of so many <u>precious</u>[^d] things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomonâ€™s <u>temple</u>[^e] . But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of <u>Solomon</u>[^f]; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.
