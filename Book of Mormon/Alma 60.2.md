# Alma 60:2

> For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of <u>condemnation</u>[^a]; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.
