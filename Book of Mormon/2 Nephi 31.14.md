# 2 Nephi 31:14

> But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should <u>deny</u>[^a] me, it would have been <u>better</u>[^b] for you that ye had not known me.
