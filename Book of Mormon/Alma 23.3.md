# Alma 23:3

> And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and <u>all</u>[^a] his <u>household</u>[^b]; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked <u>traditions</u>[^c] of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness.
