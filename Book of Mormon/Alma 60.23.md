# Alma 60:23

> Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold these things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that the <u>inward</u>[^a] vessel shall be <u>cleansed</u>[^b] first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.
