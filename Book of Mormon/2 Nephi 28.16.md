# 2 Nephi 28:16

> Wo unto them that <u>turn</u>[^a] aside the just for a thing of naught and <u>revile</u>[^b] against that which is good, and say that it is of no worth! For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are <u>fully</u>[^c] ripe in iniquity they shall perish.
