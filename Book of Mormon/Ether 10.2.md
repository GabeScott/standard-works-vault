# Ether 10:2

> And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom; for he remembered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother <u>across</u>[^a] the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord; and he begat sons and daughters.
