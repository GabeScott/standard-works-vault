# Helaman 8:22

> Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he <u>testified</u>[^a] of these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the <u>coming</u>[^b] of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.
