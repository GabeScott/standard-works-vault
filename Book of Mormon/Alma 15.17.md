# Alma 15:17

> Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great <u>check</u>[^a], yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to <u>humble</u>[^b] themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their <u>sanctuaries</u>[^c] to <u>worship</u>[^d] God before the <u>altar</u>[^e], <u>watching</u>[^f] and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from <u>death</u>[^g], and from destructionâ€”
