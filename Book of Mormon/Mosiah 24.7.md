# Mosiah 24:7

> And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to <u>trade</u>[^a] one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.
