# Moroni 7:32

> And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the <u>residue</u>[^a] of men may have <u>faith</u>[^b] in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.
