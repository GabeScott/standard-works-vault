# 1 Nephi 8:30

> But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the <u>rod of iron</u>[^a]; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
