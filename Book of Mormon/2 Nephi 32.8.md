# 2 Nephi 32:8

> And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] which teacheth a man to <u>pray</u>[^b], ye would know that ye must <u>pray</u>[^c]; for the <u>evil spirit</u>[^d] teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.
