# Helaman 6:17

> For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the <u>riches</u>[^a] of the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit <u>secret</u>[^b] murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get gain.
