# Mormon 2:10

> And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could <u>keep</u>[^a] that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.
