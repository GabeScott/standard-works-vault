# Mormon 2:8

> But behold, the land was <u>filled</u>[^a] with <u>robbers</u>[^b] and with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.
