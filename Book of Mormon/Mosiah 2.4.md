> And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had <u>appointed</u>[^a] just men to be their <u>teachers</u>[^b], and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the <u>land of Zarahemla</u>[^c], and who had taught them to <u>keep</u>[^d] the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with <u>love</u>[^e] towards God and all men.
