# Helaman 15:17

> And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly <u>destroy</u>[^a] them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things be, saith the Lord.
