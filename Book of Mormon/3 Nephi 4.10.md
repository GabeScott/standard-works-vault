# 3 Nephi 4:10

> But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not <u>fear</u>[^a] them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for <u>protection</u>[^b]; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.
