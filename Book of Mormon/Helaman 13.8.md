# Helaman 13:8

> Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will <u>withdraw</u>[^a] my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.
