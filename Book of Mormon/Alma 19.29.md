# Alma 19:29

> And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the <u>hand</u>[^a], that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an <u>awful</u>[^b] hell! O blessed God, have <u>mercy</u>[^c] on this people!
