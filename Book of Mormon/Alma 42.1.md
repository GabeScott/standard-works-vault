# Alma 42:1

> And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understandâ€”which is concerning the <u>justice</u>[^a] of God in the <u>punishment</u>[^b] of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is <u>injustice</u>[^c] that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.
