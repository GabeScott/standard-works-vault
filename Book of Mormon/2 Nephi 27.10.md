# 2 Nephi 27:10

> But the words which are <u>sealed</u>[^a] he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for behold, they <u>reveal</u>[^b] all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof.
