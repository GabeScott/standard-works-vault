# 4 Nephi 1:14

> And it came to pass that the seventy and first year passed away, and also the seventy and second year, yea, and in fine, till the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years had passed away, and the <u>disciples</u>[^a] of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to the <u>paradise</u>[^b] of God, save it were the <u>three</u>[^c] who should tarry; and there were other <u>disciples</u>[^d] <u>ordained</u>[^e] in their stead; and also many of that <u>generation</u>[^f] had passed away.
