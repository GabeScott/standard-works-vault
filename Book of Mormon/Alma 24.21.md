# Alma 24:21

> Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and <u>prostrated</u>[^a] themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.
