# Moroni 10:8

> And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the <u>gifts</u>[^a] of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are <u>different</u>[^b] ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the <u>Spirit</u>[^c] of God unto men, to profit them.
