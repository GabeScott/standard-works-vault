# Alma 14:5

> And the people went forth and witnessed against themâ€”testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should <u>not</u>[^a] save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek. Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.
