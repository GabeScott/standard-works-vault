# Ether 8:9

> Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the <u>record</u>[^a] which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an <u>account</u>[^b] concerning them of <u>old</u>[^c], that they by their <u>secret</u>[^d] plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?
