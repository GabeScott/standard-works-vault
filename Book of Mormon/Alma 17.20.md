# Alma 17:20

> And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and <u>bound</u>[^a] him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.
