# Moroni 9:24

> And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our brethren have <u>deserted</u>[^a] over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared and I shall perish and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon; for I have sacred records that I would <u>deliver</u>[^b] up unto thee.
