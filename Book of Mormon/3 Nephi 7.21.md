# 3 Nephi 7:21

> And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been <u>visited</u>[^a] by the power and <u>Spirit</u>[^b] of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.
