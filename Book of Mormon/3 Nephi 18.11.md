# 3 Nephi 18:11

> And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in <u>remembrance</u>[^a] of my <u>blood</u>[^b], which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
