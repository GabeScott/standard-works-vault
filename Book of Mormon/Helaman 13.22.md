# Helaman 13:22

> Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your <u>riches</u>[^a], not to thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto <u>boasting</u>[^b], and unto great <u>swelling</u>[^c], <u>envyings</u>[^d], strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities.
