# Alma 48:14

> Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught <u>never</u>[^a] to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.
