> And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the latter end of the <u>nineteenth</u>[^a] year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he <u>sought</u>[^b] also to <u>reign</u>[^c] over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.
