# 1 Nephi 21:23

> And <u>kings</u>[^a] shall be thy <u>nursing fathers</u>[^b], and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that <u>wait</u>[^c] for me.
