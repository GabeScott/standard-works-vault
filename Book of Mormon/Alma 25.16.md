# Alma 25:16

> Now they did not suppose that <u>salvation</u>[^a] came by the <u>law</u>[^b] of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a <u>hope</u>[^c] through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come.
