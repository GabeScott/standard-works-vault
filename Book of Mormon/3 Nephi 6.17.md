> And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year—the people having been <u>delivered up</u>[^a] for the space of a long time to be carried about by the <u>temptations</u>[^b] of the devil whithersoever he desired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should—and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness.
