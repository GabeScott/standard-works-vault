# 1 Nephi 22:13

> And the blood of that great and <u>abominable</u>[^a] church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall <u>war</u>[^b] among themselves, and the sword of their <u>own</u>[^c] hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood.
