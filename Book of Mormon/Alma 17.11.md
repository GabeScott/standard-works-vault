# Alma 17:11

> And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be <u>patient</u>[^a] in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good <u>examples</u>[^b] unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.
