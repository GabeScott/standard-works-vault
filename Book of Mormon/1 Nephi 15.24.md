# 1 Nephi 15:24

> And I said unto them that it was the <u>word</u>[^a] of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would <u>hold</u>[^b] fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the <u>temptations</u>[^c] and the fiery <u>darts</u>[^d] of the <u>adversary</u>[^e] overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.
