# Alma 9:14

> Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been <u>cut off</u>[^a] from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.
