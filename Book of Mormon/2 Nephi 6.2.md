# 2 Nephi 6:2

> Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy <u>order</u>[^a], and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a <u>king</u>[^b] or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.
