# 2 Nephi 6:11

> Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be suffered to <u>perish</u>[^a], because of the prayers of the faithful; they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that <u>when</u>[^b] they shall come to the <u>knowledge</u>[^c] of their Redeemer, they shall be <u>gathered</u>[^d] together again to the <u>lands</u>[^e] of their inheritance.
