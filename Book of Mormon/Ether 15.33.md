# Ether 15:33

> And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth. And he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he <u>finished</u>[^a] his <u>record</u>[^b]; (and the <u>hundredth</u>[^c] part I have not written) and he hid them in a manner that the people of Limhi did find them.
