# 1 Nephi 2:16

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the <u>mysteries</u>[^a] of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did <u>visit</u>[^b] me, and did <u>soften</u>[^c] my heart that I did <u>believe</u>[^d] all the words which had been spoken by my <u>father</u>[^e]; wherefore, I did not <u>rebel</u>[^f] against him like unto my brothers.
