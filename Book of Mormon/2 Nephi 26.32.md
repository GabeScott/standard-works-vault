# 2 Nephi 26:32

> And again, the Lord God hath <u>commanded</u>[^a] that men should not murder; that they should not lie; that they should not <u>steal</u>[^b]; that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in <u>vain</u>[^c]; that they should not <u>envy</u>[^d]; that they should not have <u>malice</u>[^e]; that they should not contend one with another; that they should not commit <u>whoredoms</u>[^f]; and that they should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them shall perish.
