# 1 Nephi 17:48

> And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye <u>touch</u>[^a] me not, for I am filled with the <u>power</u>[^b] of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall <u>wither</u>[^c] even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.
