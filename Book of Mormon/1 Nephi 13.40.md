# 1 Nephi 13:40

> And the angel spake unto me, saying: These <u>last records</u>[^a], which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall <u>establish</u>[^b] the truth of the <u>first</u>[^c], which are of the <u>twelve apostles</u>[^d] of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the <u>Savior</u>[^e] of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.
