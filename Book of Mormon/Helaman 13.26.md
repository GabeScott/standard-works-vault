# Helaman 13:26

> Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a <u>prophet</u>[^a] come among you and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your <u>sins</u>[^b] and iniquities, ye are <u>angry</u>[^c] with him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a <u>false</u>[^d] <u>prophet</u>[^e], and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he <u>testifieth</u>[^f] that your deeds are evil.
