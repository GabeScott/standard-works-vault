# Ether 6:25

> And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their <u>king</u>[^a] . And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.
