# Alma 43:23

> But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should <u>inquire</u>[^a] of the Lord <u>whither</u>[^b] the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites.
