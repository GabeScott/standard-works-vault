# Helaman 12:2

> Yea, and we may see at the very <u>time</u>[^a] when he doth <u>prosper</u>[^b] his people, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of <u>precious</u>[^c] things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do <u>harden</u>[^d] their hearts, and do <u>forget</u>[^e] the Lord their God, and do <u>trample</u>[^f] under their feet the Holy Oneâ€”yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.
