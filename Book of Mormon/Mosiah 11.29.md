# Mosiah 11:29

> Now the eyes of the people were <u>blinded</u>[^a]; therefore they <u>hardened</u>[^b] their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him. And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings.
