# Mosiah 1:2

> And it came to pass that he had three <u>sons</u>[^a]; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be <u>taught</u>[^b] in all the <u>language</u>[^c] of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.
