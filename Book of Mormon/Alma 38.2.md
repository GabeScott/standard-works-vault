# Alma 38:2

> And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your <u>steadiness</u>[^a] and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that <u>endureth</u>[^b] to the end.
