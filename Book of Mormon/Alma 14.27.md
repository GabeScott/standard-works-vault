# Alma 14:27

> And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the <u>prison</u>[^a]; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.
