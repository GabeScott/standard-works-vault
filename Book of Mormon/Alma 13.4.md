# Alma 13:4

> And thus they have been <u>called</u>[^a] to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and <u>blindness</u>[^b] of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great <u>privilege</u>[^c] as their brethren.
