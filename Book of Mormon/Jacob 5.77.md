# Jacob 5:77

> And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the <u>good</u>[^a] and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place. And then cometh the <u>season</u>[^b] and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be <u>burned</u>[^c] with <u>fire</u>[^d] .
