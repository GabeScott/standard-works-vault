# 3 Nephi 28:29

> And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto all the <u>scattered</u>[^a] tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God which is in them.
