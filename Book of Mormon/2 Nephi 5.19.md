# 2 Nephi 5:19

> And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their <u>ruler</u>[^a] and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their <u>teacher</u>[^b], according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.
