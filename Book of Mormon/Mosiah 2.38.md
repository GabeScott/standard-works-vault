# Mosiah 2:38

> Therefore if that man <u>repenteth</u>[^a] not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine <u>justice</u>[^b] do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own <u>guilt</u>[^c], which doth cause him to shrink from the <u>presence</u>[^d] of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and <u>pain</u>[^e], and <u>anguish</u>[^f], which is like an unquenchable <u>fire</u>[^g], whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.
