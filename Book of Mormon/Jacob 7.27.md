# Jacob 7:27

> And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son <u>Enos</u>[^a] : Take these <u>plates</u>[^b] . And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had <u>commanded</u>[^c] me, and he promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been <u>small</u>[^d]; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.
