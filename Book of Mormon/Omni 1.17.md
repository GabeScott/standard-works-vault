# Omni 1:17

> And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless, they had had many wars and serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and their <u>language</u>[^a] had become corrupted; and they had brought no <u>records</u>[^b] with them; and they denied the being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand them.
