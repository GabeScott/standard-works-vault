# Alma 61:4

> And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great <u>flattery</u>[^a], and they have <u>led away</u>[^b] the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our <u>freemen</u>[^c] that they have not come unto you.
