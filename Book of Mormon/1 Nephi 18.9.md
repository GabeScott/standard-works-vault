# 1 Nephi 18:9

> And after we had been <u>driven</u>[^a] forth before the wind for the space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much <u>rudeness</u>[^b], yea, even that they did forget by what power they had been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.
