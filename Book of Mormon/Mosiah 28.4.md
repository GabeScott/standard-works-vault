# Mosiah 28:4

> And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very <u>vilest</u>[^a] of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite <u>mercy</u>[^b] to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.
