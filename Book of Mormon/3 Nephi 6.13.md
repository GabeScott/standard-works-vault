# 3 Nephi 6:13

> Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and <u>persecution</u>[^a] and all manner of <u>afflictions</u>[^b], and would not turn and <u>revile</u>[^c] again, but were humble and penitent before God.
