# Alma 11:45

> Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the <u>death</u>[^a] of the mortal body, and also concerning the <u>resurrection</u>[^b] of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is <u>raised</u>[^c] to an <u>immortal</u>[^d] body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can <u>die</u>[^e] no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming <u>spiritual</u>[^f] and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.
