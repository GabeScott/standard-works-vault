# Mosiah 3:26

> Therefore, they have drunk out of the <u>cup</u>[^a] of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that <u>Adam</u>[^b] should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden <u>fruit</u>[^c]; therefore, <u>mercy</u>[^d] could have claim on them no more forever.
