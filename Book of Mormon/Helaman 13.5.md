# Helaman 13:5

> And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the <u>sword</u>[^a] of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.
