# Alma 26:16

> Therefore, let us <u>glory</u>[^a], yea, we will <u>glory</u>[^b] in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his <u>mercy</u>[^c], and of his long-suffering towards the children of men? Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.
