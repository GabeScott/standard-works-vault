# Alma 7:3

> And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful <u>dilemma</u>[^a] that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.
