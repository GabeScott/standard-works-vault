# Mosiah 3:13

> And the Lord God hath sent his holy <u>prophets</u>[^a] among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive <u>remission</u>[^b] of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even <u>as</u>[^c] though he had already come among them.
