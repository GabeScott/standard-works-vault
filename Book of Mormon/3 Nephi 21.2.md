# 3 Nephi 21:2

> And behold, this is the thing which I will give unto you for a sign—for verily I say unto you that <u>when</u>[^a] these things which I declare unto you, and which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning this people who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be scattered by them;
