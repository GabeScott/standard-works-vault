# 3 Nephi 1:14

> Behold, I <u>come</u>[^a] unto my own, to <u>fulfil</u>[^b] all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the <u>foundation</u>[^c] of the world, and to do the <u>will</u>[^d], <u>both</u>[^e] <u>of</u>[^f] the Father and of the Son—of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.
