# 3 Nephi 8:25

> And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city <u>Moronihah</u>[^a] . And thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.
