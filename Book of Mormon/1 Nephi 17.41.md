# 1 Nephi 17:41

> And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for they <u>hardened</u>[^a] their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straitened them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying <u>serpents</u>[^b] among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be <u>healed</u>[^c]; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the <u>simpleness</u>[^d] of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many who perished.
