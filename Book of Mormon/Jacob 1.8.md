# Jacob 1:8

> Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men <u>not to rebel</u>[^a] against God, to <u>provoke</u>[^b] him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his <u>cross</u>[^c] and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
