# Enos 1:10

> And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my <u>mind</u>[^a] again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I have <u>given</u>[^b] unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I <u>curse</u>[^c] it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their <u>transgressions</u>[^d] will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.
