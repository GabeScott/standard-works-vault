# Alma 14:6

> And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the <u>blindness</u>[^a] of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his <u>lying</u>[^b] words; and his soul began to be <u>harrowed up</u>[^c] under a <u>consciousness</u>[^d] of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.
