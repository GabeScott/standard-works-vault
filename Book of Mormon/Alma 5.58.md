# Alma 5:58

> For the names of the righteous shall be written in the <u>book of life</u>[^a], and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.
