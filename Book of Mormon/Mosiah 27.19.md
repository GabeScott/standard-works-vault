# Mosiah 27:19

> And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became <u>dumb</u>[^a], that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.
