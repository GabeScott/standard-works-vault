# 2 Nephi 3:7

> Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice <u>seer</u>[^a] will I <u>raise up</u>[^b] out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the <u>knowledge</u>[^c] of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.
