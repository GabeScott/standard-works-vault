# 3 Nephi 10:14

> And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him <u>search</u>[^a] them, and see and behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by <u>tempests</u>[^b], and by whirlwinds, and by the <u>opening</u>[^c] of the earth to receive them, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets.
