# Mosiah 3:5

> For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the <u>Lord</u>[^a] <u>Omnipotent</u>[^b] who <u>reigneth</u>[^c], who was, and is from all <u>eternity</u>[^d] to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a <u>tabernacle</u>[^e] of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty <u>miracles</u>[^f], such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the <u>blind</u>[^g] to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.
