# 2 Nephi 29:9

> And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the <u>same</u>[^a] yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my <u>words</u>[^b] according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken one <u>word</u>[^c] ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my <u>work</u>[^d] is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.
