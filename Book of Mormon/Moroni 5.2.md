# Moroni 5:2

> O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this <u>wine</u>[^a] to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in <u>remembrance</u>[^b] of the <u>blood</u>[^c] of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always remember him, that they may have his <u>Spirit</u>[^d] to be with them. Amen.
