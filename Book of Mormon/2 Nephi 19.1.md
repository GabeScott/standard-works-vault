# 2 Nephi 19:1

> <u>Nevertheless</u>[^a], the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the <u>land</u>[^b] of <u>Zebulun</u>[^c], and the land of <u>Naphtali</u>[^d], and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.
