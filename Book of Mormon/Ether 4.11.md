# Ether 4:11

> But he that <u>believeth</u>[^a] these things which I have spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall <u>know</u>[^b] and bear record. For because of my Spirit he shall <u>know</u>[^c] that these things are <u>true</u>[^d]; for it persuadeth men to do good.
