# Mosiah 7:1

> And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who <u>went</u>[^a] up to dwell in the land of <u>Lehi-Nephi</u>[^b], or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of <u>Zarahemla</u>[^c]; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.
