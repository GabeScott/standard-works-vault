# 2 Nephi 4:32

> May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my <u>heart</u>[^a] is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may <u>walk</u>[^b] in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!
