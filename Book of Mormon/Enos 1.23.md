# Enos 1:23

> And there was nothing save it was exceeding <u>harshness</u>[^a], <u>preaching</u>[^b] and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually <u>reminding</u>[^c] them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these thingsâ€”stirring them up <u>continually</u>[^d] to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them.
