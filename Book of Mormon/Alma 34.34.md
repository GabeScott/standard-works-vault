# Alma 34:34

> Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful <u>crisis</u>[^a], that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth <u>possess</u>[^b] your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.
