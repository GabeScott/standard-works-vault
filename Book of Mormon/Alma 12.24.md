# Alma 12:24

> And we see that <u>death</u>[^a] comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto <u>man</u>[^b] in which he might repent; therefore this life became a <u>probationary state</u>[^c]; a time to <u>prepare</u>[^d] to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.
