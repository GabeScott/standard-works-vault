# Alma 34:35

> For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become <u>subjected</u>[^a] to the spirit of the devil, and he doth <u>seal</u>[^b] you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.
