# 3 Nephi 2:1

> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those <u>signs</u>[^a] and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seenâ€”
