> Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal <u>justly</u>[^a], <u>judge</u>[^b] righteously, and do <u>good</u>[^c] continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your <u>reward</u>[^d]; yea, ye shall have <u>mercy</u>[^e] restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.
