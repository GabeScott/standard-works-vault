# Helaman 4:5

> And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining <u>possession</u>[^a] of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.
