# Jacob 2:35

> Behold, ye have done <u>greater</u>[^a] iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the <u>strictness</u>[^b] of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.
