# 4 Nephi 1:16

> And there were no <u>envyings</u>[^a], nor <u>strifes</u>[^b], nor <u>tumults</u>[^c], nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of <u>lasciviousness</u>[^d]; and surely there could not be a <u>happier</u>[^e] people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.
