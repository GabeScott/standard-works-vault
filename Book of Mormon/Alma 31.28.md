# Alma 31:28

> Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their <u>bracelets</u>[^a], and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say—We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.
