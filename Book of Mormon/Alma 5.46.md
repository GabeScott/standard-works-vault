# Alma 5:46

> Behold, I say unto you they are made <u>known</u>[^a] unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have <u>fasted</u>[^b] and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of <u>revelation</u>[^c] which is in me.
