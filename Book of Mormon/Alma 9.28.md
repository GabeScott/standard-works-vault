# Alma 9:28

> Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a <u>reward</u>[^a] of their <u>works</u>[^b], according to that which they have beenâ€”if they have been righteous they shall <u>reap</u>[^c] the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the <u>damnation</u>[^d] of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.
