# Alma 30:17

> And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man <u>fared</u>[^a] in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and <u>whatsoever</u>[^b] a man did was <u>no</u>[^c] crime.
