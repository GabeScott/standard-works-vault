# 1 Nephi 3:7

> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I <u>will</u>[^a] go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no <u>commandments</u>[^b] unto the children of men, save he shall <u>prepare</u>[^c] a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
