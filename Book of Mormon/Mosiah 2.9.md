# Mosiah 2:9

> And these are the words which he <u>spake</u>[^a] and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to <u>trifle</u>[^b] with the words which I shall speak, but that you should <u>hearken</u>[^c] unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your <u>hearts</u>[^d] that ye may understand, and your <u>minds</u>[^e] that the <u>mysteries</u>[^f] of God may be unfolded to your view.
