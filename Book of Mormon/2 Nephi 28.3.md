# 2 Nephi 28:3

> For it shall come to pass in that day that the <u>churches</u>[^a] which are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord’s; and the others shall say: I, I am the Lord’s; and thus shall every one say that hath built up <u>churches</u>[^b], and not unto the Lord—
