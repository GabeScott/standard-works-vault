# Alma 41:13

> O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again <u>evil</u>[^a] for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.
