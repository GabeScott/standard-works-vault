# Ether 13:7

> For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of <u>Egypt</u>[^a], even so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should <u>perish</u>[^b] not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not.
