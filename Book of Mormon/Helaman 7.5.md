# Helaman 7:5

> Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go <u>unpunished</u>[^a] because of their <u>money</u>[^b]; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the <u>world</u>[^c], and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own willsâ€”
