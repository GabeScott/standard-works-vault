# Alma 54:11

> But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a <u>child</u>[^a] of hell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will exchange.
