# 2 Nephi 7:1

> <u>Yea</u>[^a], for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the <u>bill</u>[^b] of your motherâ€™s <u>divorcement</u>[^c] ? To whom have I put thee away, or to which of my <u>creditors</u>[^d] have I <u>sold</u>[^e] you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
