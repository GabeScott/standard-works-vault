# Alma 45:12

> Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and <u>lasciviousness</u>[^a], and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the <u>fourth</u>[^b] generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.
