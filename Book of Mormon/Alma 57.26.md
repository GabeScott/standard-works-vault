# Alma 57:26

> And now, their <u>preservation</u>[^a] was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous <u>power</u>[^b] of God, because of their exceeding <u>faith</u>[^c] in that which they had been taught to believeâ€”that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.
