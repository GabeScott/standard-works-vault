# Alma 5:15

> Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who <u>created</u>[^a] you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption <u>raised</u>[^b] in incorruption, to stand before God to be <u>judged</u>[^c] according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?
