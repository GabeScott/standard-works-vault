# Mosiah 3:7

> And lo, he shall <u>suffer</u>[^a] <u>temptations</u>[^b], and pain of body, <u>hunger</u>[^c], thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can <u>suffer</u>[^d], except it be unto death; for behold, <u>blood</u>[^e] cometh from every pore, so great shall be his <u>anguish</u>[^f] for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.
