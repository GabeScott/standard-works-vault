# Ether 11:6

> And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had testified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and their bones should become as <u>heaps</u>[^a] of earth upon the face of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.
