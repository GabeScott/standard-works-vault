# Alma 34:31

> Yea, I would that ye would come forth and <u>harden</u>[^a] not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the <u>day</u>[^b] of your <u>salvation</u>[^c]; and therefore, if ye will repent and <u>harden</u>[^d] not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.
