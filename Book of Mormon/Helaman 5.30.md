# Helaman 5:30

> And it came to pass when they heard this <u>voice</u>[^a], and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a <u>still voice</u>[^b] of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soulâ€”
