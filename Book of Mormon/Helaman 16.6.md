# Helaman 16:6

> But the <u>more</u>[^a] part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: <u>Take</u>[^b] this fellow and bind him, for behold he <u>hath</u>[^c] a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.
