# Alma 17:13

> And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they <u>separated</u>[^a] themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their <u>harvest</u>[^b]; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.
