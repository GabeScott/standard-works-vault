# Mosiah 29:23

> And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he <u>causeth</u>[^a] to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous <u>king</u>[^b] doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.
