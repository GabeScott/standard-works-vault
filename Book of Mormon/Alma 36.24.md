# Alma 36:24

> Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto <u>repentance</u>[^a]; that I might bring them to <u>taste</u>[^b] of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be <u>born of God</u>[^c], and be <u>filled</u>[^d] with the Holy Ghost.
