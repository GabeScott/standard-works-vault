# Ether 2:10

> For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be <u>swept off</u>[^a]; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the <u>fulness</u>[^b] of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are <u>swept off</u>[^c] .
