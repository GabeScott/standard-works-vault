# Jacob 1:15

> And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many <u>wives</u>[^a] and <u>concubines</u>[^b], and also Solomon, his son.
