# Alma 38:8

> And it came to pass that I was <u>three</u>[^a] days and three nights in the most bitter <u>pain</u>[^b] and <u>anguish</u>[^c] of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a <u>remission</u>[^d] of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.
