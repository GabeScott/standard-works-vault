# 3 Nephi 17:24

> And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and <u>encircled</u>[^a] those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.
