# Mosiah 10:1

> And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace. And I caused that there should be <u>weapons</u>[^a] of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.
