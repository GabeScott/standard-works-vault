# Omni 1:11

> And behold, the <u>record</u>[^a] of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the <u>kings</u>[^b], according to the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I make an end.
