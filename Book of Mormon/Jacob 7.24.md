# Jacob 7:24

> And it came to pass that many means were devised to <u>reclaim</u>[^a] and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was <u>vain</u>[^b], for they delighted in <u>wars</u>[^c] and <u>bloodshed</u>[^d], and they had an eternal <u>hatred</u>[^e] against us, their brethren. And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.
