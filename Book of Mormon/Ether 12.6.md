# Ether 12:6

> And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that <u>faith</u>[^a] is things which are <u>hoped</u>[^b] for and <u>not</u>[^c] seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no <u>witness</u>[^d] until after the <u>trial</u>[^e] of your faith.
