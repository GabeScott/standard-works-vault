# 4 Nephi 1:5

> And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did <u>heal</u>[^a] the sick, and <u>raise</u>[^b] the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of <u>miracles</u>[^c] did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.
