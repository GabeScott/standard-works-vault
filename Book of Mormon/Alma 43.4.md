# Alma 43:4

> For behold, it came to pass that the <u>Zoramites</u>[^a] became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.
