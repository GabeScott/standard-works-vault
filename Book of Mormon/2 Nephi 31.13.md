# 2 Nephi 31:13

> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall <u>follow</u>[^a] the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no <u>hypocrisy</u>[^b] and no deception before God, but with real <u>intent</u>[^c], repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are <u>willing</u>[^d] to take upon you the <u>name</u>[^e] of Christ, by <u>baptism</u>[^f] —yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word, behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the <u>baptism of fire</u>[^g] and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the <u>tongue</u>[^h] of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.
