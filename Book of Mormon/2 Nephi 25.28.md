# 2 Nephi 25:28

> And now behold, my people, ye are a <u>stiffnecked</u>[^a] people; wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as a <u>testimony</u>[^b] against you; for they are sufficient to <u>teach</u>[^c] any man the <u>right</u>[^d] way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the law.
