# 3 Nephi 8:1

> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be <u>true</u>[^a], for behold, it was a <u>just</u>[^b] man who did keep the record—for he truly did <u>many</u>[^c] <u>miracles</u>[^d] in the <u>name</u>[^e] of Jesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—
