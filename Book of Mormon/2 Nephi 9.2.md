> That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be <u>restored</u>[^a] to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be <u>gathered</u>[^b] home to the <u>lands</u>[^c] of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.
