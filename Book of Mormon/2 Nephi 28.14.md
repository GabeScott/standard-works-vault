# 2 Nephi 28:14

> They wear <u>stiff</u>[^a] necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and <u>whoredoms</u>[^b], they have all <u>gone astray</u>[^c] save it be a <u>few</u>[^d], who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are <u>led</u>[^e], that in many instances they do <u>err</u>[^f] because they are taught by the precepts of men.
