# Mormon 9:24

> And <u>these signs</u>[^a] shall follow them that believeâ€”in my name shall they cast out <u>devils</u>[^b]; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay <u>hands</u>[^c] on the sick and they shall recover;
