# Alma 4:9

> And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great <u>contentions</u>[^a] among the people of the church; yea, there were <u>envyings</u>[^b], and <u>strife</u>[^c], and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.
