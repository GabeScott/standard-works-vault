# 2 Nephi 9:7

> Wherefore, it must needs be an <u>infinite</u>[^a] <u>atonement</u>[^b] —save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the <u>first</u>[^c] judgment which came upon man must needs have <u>remained</u>[^d] to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
