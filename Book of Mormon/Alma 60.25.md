# Alma 60:25

> And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a true <u>spirit</u>[^a] of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them—
