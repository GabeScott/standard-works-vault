# Mosiah 15:11

> Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the <u>prophets</u>[^a], yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lordâ€”I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the <u>kingdom</u>[^b] of God.
