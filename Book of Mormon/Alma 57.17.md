# Alma 57:17

> But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now behold, we did not <u>inquire</u>[^a] of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.
