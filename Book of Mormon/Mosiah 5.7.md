# Mosiah 5:7

> And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the <u>children</u>[^a] of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are <u>changed</u>[^b] through faith on his name; therefore, ye are <u>born</u>[^c] of him and have become his <u>sons</u>[^d] and his daughters.
