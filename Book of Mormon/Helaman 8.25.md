# Helaman 8:25

> But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and <u>rebelled</u>[^a] against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves <u>treasures</u>[^b] in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of <u>judgment</u>[^c] .
