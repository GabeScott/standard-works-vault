# 2 Nephi 5:21

> And he had caused the <u>cursing</u>[^a] to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and <u>delightsome</u>[^b], that they might not be <u>enticing</u>[^c] unto my people the Lord God did cause a <u>skin</u>[^d] of <u>blackness</u>[^e] to come upon them.
