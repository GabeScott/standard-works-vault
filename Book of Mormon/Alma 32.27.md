# Alma 32:27

> But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than <u>desire</u>[^a] to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.
