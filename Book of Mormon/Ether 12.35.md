# Ether 12:35

> Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not <u>charity</u>[^a], because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and <u>take away</u>[^b] their <u>talent</u>[^c], yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly.
