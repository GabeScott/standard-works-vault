# Alma 9:16

> For there are many promises which are <u>extended</u>[^a] to the Lamanites; for it is because of the <u>traditions</u>[^b] of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of <u>ignorance</u>[^c]; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and <u>prolong</u>[^d] their existence in the land.
