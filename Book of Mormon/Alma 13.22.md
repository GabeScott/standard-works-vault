# Alma 13:22

> Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the <u>mouth</u>[^a] of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.
