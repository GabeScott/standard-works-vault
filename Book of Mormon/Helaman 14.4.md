# Helaman 14:4

> Therefore, there shall be one <u>day</u>[^a] and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is <u>born</u>[^b] .
