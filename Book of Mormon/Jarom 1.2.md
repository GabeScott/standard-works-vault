# Jarom 1:2

> And as <u>these plates</u>[^a] are <u>small</u>[^b], and as these things are <u>written</u>[^c] for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the <u>Lamanites</u>[^d], wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. For what could I write more than my fathers have written? For have not they revealed the plan of salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.
