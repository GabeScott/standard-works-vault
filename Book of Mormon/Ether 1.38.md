# Ether 1:38

> And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and <u>inquire</u>[^a] of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is <u>choice</u>[^b] above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance.
