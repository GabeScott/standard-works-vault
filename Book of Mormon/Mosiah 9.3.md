# Mosiah 9:3

> And yet, I being <u>over-zealous</u>[^a] to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our <u>journey</u>[^b] into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.
