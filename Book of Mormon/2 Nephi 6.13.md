# 2 Nephi 6:13

> Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be <u>ashamed</u>[^a] . For the people of the Lord are they who <u>wait</u>[^b] for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.
