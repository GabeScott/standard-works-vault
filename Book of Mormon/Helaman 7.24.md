# Helaman 7:24

> For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will <u>lengthen</u>[^a] out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly <u>destroyed</u>[^b] except thou shalt repent.
