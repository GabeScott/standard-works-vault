# 2 Nephi 2:12

> Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no <u>purpose</u>[^a] in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the <u>justice</u>[^b] of God.
