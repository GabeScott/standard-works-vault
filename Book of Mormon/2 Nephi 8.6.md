# 2 Nephi 8:6

> Lift up your eyes to the <u>heavens</u>[^a], and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall <u>vanish</u>[^b] away like smoke, and the earth shall <u>wax old</u>[^c] like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
