# 3 Nephi 27:8

> And how be it <u>my</u>[^a] <u>church</u>[^b] save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses’ name then it be Moses’ church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.
