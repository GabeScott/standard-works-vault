# 1 Nephi 19:24

> Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet, ye who are a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of the house of Israel, a <u>branch</u>[^b] who have been broken off; <u>hear</u>[^c] ye the words of the prophet, which were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from whom ye have been broken off; for after this manner has the prophet written.
