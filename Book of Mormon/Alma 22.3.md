# Alma 22:3

> And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat <u>troubled</u>[^a] in mind because of the <u>generosity</u>[^b] and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.
