# Alma 13:1

> And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God <u>ordained</u>[^a] priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.
