# Alma 18:36

> Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and <u>rehearsed</u>[^a] and laid before him the <u>records</u>[^b] and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the <u>prophets</u>[^c], even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.
