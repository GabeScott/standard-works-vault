> And many <u>people</u>[^a] shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the <u>mountain</u>[^b] of the Lord, to the <u>house</u>[^c] of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will <u>walk</u>[^d] in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
