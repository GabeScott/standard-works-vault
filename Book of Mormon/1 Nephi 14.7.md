# 1 Nephi 14:7

> For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a <u>marvelous work</u>[^a] among the children of men; a <u>work</u>[^b] which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either to the convincing of them unto <u>peace</u>[^c] and <u>life eternal</u>[^d], or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the <u>captivity</u>[^e] of the devil, of which I have spoken.
