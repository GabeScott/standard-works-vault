# Alma 9:24

> For behold, the <u>promises</u>[^a] of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall <u>utterly</u>[^b] be destroyed from off the face of the earth?
