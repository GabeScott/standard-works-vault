# 2 Nephi 2:8

> Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, <u>save</u>[^a] it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who <u>layeth</u>[^b] down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the <u>resurrection</u>[^c] of the dead, being the first that should rise.
