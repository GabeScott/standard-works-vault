# Mosiah 28:1

> Now it came to pass that after the <u>sons of Mosiah</u>[^a] had done all these things, they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had <u>selected</u>[^b], go up to the land of <u>Nephi</u>[^c] that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanitesâ€”
