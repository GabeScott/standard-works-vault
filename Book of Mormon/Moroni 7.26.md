# Moroni 7:26

> And after that he came men also were <u>saved</u>[^a] by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the <u>sons</u>[^b] of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: <u>Whatsoever</u>[^c] thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you.
