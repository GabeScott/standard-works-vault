# 2 Nephi 25:8

> Wherefore, they are of <u>worth</u>[^a] unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine <u>own</u>[^b] people; for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the <u>last days</u>[^c]; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written them.
