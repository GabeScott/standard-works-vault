# 4 Nephi 1:1

> And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were <u>baptized</u>[^a] in the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.
