# Mosiah 18:7

> And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did <u>teach</u>[^a] them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.
