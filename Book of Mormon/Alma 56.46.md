# Alma 56:46

> For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will <u>not</u>[^a] suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.
