# Alma 34:39

> Yea, and I also <u>exhort</u>[^a] you, my brethren, that ye be <u>watchful</u>[^b] unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the <u>temptations</u>[^c] of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you <u>no</u>[^d] good thing.
