# 2 Nephi 7:2

> Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I <u>called</u>[^a], yea, there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I <u>dry up</u>[^b] the <u>sea</u>[^c], I make their <u>rivers</u>[^d] a wilderness and their <u>fish</u>[^e] to stink because the waters are dried up, and they die because of thirst.
