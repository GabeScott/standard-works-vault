# Alma 40:3

> Behold, he bringeth to pass the <u>resurrection</u>[^a] of the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many <u>mysteries</u>[^b] which are <u>kept</u>[^c], that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know—that is concerning the resurrection.
