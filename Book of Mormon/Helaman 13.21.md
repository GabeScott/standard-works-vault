# Helaman 13:21

> Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are <u>cursed</u>[^a] because of your riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and have not <u>hearkened</u>[^b] unto the words of him who gave them unto you.
