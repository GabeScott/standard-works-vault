# Alma 12:32

> Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made <u>known</u>[^a] unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second <u>death</u>[^b], which was an everlasting <u>death</u>[^c] as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of <u>justice</u>[^d] could not be destroyed, according to the supreme <u>goodness</u>[^e] of God.
