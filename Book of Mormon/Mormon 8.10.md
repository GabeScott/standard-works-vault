# Mormon 8:10

> And there are none that do know the true God save it be the <u>disciples</u>[^a] of Jesus, who did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not suffer them to <u>remain</u>[^b] with the people; and whether they be upon the face of the land no man knoweth.
