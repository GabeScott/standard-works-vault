# Alma 22:20

> Now the servants had seen the cause of the kingâ€™s fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is <u>mightier</u>[^a] than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.
