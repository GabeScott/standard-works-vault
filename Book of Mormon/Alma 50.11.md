# Alma 50:11

> And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the <u>river Sidon</u>[^a] â€”the Nephites possessing all the land <u>northward</u>[^b], yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.
