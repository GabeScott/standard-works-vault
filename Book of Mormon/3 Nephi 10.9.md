# 3 Nephi 10:9

> And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning, and the <u>darkness</u>[^a] dispersed from off the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the <u>rocks</u>[^b] did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away.
