# 2 Nephi 2:15

> And to bring about his eternal <u>purposes</u>[^a] in the end of man, after he had <u>created</u>[^b] our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the <u>fowls</u>[^c] of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the <u>forbidden</u>[^d] <u>fruit</u>[^e] in <u>opposition</u>[^f] to the <u>tree of life</u>[^g]; the one being sweet and the other bitter.
