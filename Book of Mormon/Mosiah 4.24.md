# Mosiah 4:24

> And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I <u>give</u>[^a] not because I <u>have</u>[^b] not, but if I had I would <u>give</u>[^c] .
