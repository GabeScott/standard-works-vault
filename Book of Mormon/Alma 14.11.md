# Alma 14:11

> But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in <u>glory</u>[^a]; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the <u>judgments</u>[^b] which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the <u>blood</u>[^c] of the <u>innocent</u>[^d] shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.
