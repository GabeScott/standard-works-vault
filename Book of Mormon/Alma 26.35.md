# Alma 26:35

> Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all <u>power</u>[^a], <u>all</u>[^b] wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a <u>merciful</u>[^c] Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.
