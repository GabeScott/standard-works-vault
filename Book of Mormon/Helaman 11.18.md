# Helaman 11:18

> And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a <u>great</u>[^a] prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.
