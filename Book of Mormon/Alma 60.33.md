# Alma 60:33

> Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and <u>iniquities</u>[^a], ye shall <u>go</u>[^b] up to battle against them.
