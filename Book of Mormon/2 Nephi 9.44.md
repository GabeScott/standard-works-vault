# 2 Nephi 9:44

> O, my beloved brethren, remember my words. Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them before you; I pray the God of my salvation that he view me with his <u>all-searching</u>[^a] eye; wherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be judged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I <u>shook</u>[^b] your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with brightness before him, and am <u>rid</u>[^c] of your blood.
