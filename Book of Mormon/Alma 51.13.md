# Alma 51:13

> And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the <u>people</u>[^a] of <u>liberty</u>[^b], that they would not take up arms to defend their country.
