# Alma 23:2

> Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their <u>synagogues</u>[^a], nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their <u>sanctuaries</u>[^b] .
