# Mosiah 3:15

> And many signs, and wonders, and <u>types</u>[^a], and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they <u>hardened</u>[^b] their hearts, and understood not that the <u>law</u>[^c] of Moses availeth nothing <u>except</u>[^d] it were through the <u>atonement</u>[^e] of his blood.
