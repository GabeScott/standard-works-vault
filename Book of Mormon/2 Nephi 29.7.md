# 2 Nephi 29:7

> Know ye not that there are more <u>nations</u>[^a] than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the <u>isles</u>[^b] of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the <u>earth</u>[^c] beneath; and I bring forth my <u>word</u>[^d] unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?
