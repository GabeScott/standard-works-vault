# 1 Nephi 15:17

> And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be <u>rejected</u>[^a] of the Jews, or of the house of Israel.
