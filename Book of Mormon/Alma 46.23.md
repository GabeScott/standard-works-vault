# Alma 46:23

> Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of <u>Joseph</u>[^b], whose <u>coat</u>[^c] was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.
