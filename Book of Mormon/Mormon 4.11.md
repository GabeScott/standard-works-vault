# Mormon 4:11

> And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they <u>delighted</u>[^a] in the shedding of blood continually.
