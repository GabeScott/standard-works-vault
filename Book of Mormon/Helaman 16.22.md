# Helaman 16:22

> And many more things did the people <u>imagine</u>[^a] up in their hearts, which were foolish and <u>vain</u>[^b]; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading <u>rumors</u>[^c] and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.
