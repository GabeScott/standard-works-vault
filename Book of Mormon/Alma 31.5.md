# Alma 31:5

> And now, as the <u>preaching</u>[^a] of the <u>word</u>[^b] had a great tendency to <u>lead</u>[^c] the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.
