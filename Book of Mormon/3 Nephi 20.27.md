# 3 Nephi 20:27

> And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the covenant which he made with Abraham, saying: <u>In</u>[^a] thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessedâ€”unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which <u>blessing</u>[^b] upon the <u>Gentiles</u>[^c] shall make them mighty above all, unto the <u>scattering</u>[^d] of my people, O house of Israel.
