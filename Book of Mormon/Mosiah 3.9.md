# Mosiah 3:9

> And lo, he cometh unto his own, that <u>salvation</u>[^a] might come unto the children of men even through <u>faith</u>[^b] on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a <u>devil</u>[^c], and shall <u>scourge</u>[^d] him, and shall <u>crucify</u>[^e] him.
