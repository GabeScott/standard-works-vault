# Alma 24:1

> And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of <u>Amulon</u>[^a], and also in the land of <u>Helam</u>[^b], and who were in the land of <u>Jerusalem</u>[^c], and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of <u>Anti-Nephi-Lehi</u>[^d], were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren.
