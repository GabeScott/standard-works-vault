# Alma 52:20

> And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities. But behold, Jacob, who was a <u>Zoramite</u>[^a], would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains.
