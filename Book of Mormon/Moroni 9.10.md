# Moroni 9:10

> And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most <u>cruel</u>[^a] manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.
