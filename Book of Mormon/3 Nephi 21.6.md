# 3 Nephi 21:6

> For thus it behooveth the Father that it should come forth from the <u>Gentiles</u>[^a], that he may show forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be baptized in my name and know of the true points of my doctrine, that they may be <u>numbered</u>[^b] among my people, O house of Israel;
