# Mosiah 26:29

> Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye <u>judge</u>[^a] <u>according</u>[^b] to the sins which he has committed; and if he <u>confess</u>[^c] his sins before thee and me, and <u>repenteth</u>[^d] in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye <u>forgive</u>[^e], and I will forgive him also.
