# Moroni 6:7

> And they were strict to observe that there should be <u>no iniquity</u>[^a] among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and <u>three</u>[^b] witnesses of the church did condemn them before the <u>elders</u>[^c], and if they repented not, and <u>confessed</u>[^d] not, their names were <u>blotted out</u>[^e], and they were not <u>numbered</u>[^f] among the people of Christ.
