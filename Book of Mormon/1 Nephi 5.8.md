# 1 Nephi 5:8

> And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath <u>commanded</u>[^a] my husband to <u>flee</u>[^b] into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could <u>accomplish</u>[^c] the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.
