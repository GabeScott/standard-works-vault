# Mosiah 24:9

> For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been <u>one</u>[^a] of the king’s priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put <u>tasks</u>[^b] upon them, and put <u>task-masters</u>[^c] over them.
