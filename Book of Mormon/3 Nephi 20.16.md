# 3 Nephi 20:16

> Then shall ye, who are a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young <u>lion</u>[^b] among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through both <u>treadeth</u>[^c] down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
