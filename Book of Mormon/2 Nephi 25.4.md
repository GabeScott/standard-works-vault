# 2 Nephi 25:4

> Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the <u>spirit</u>[^a] of <u>prophecy</u>[^b] . But I give unto you a <u>prophecy</u>[^c], according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the <u>plainness</u>[^d] which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in <u>plainness</u>[^e] unto my people, that they may learn.
