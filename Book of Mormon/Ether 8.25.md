# Ether 8:25

> For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the <u>freedom</u>[^a] of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who <u>beguiled</u>[^b] our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath <u>hardened</u>[^c] the hearts of men that they have <u>murdered</u>[^d] the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.
