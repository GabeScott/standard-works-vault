# Alma 18:3

> And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he <u>cannot</u>[^a] be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they <u>scatter</u>[^b] the king’s flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and <u>great</u>[^c] strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.
