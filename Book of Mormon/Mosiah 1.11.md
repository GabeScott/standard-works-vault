# Mosiah 1:11

> And moreover, I shall give this people a <u>name</u>[^a], that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a <u>diligent</u>[^b] people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.
