# Ether 2:24

> For behold, ye shall be as a <u>whale</u>[^a] in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the <u>winds</u>[^b] have gone forth <u>out</u>[^c] of my mouth, and also the <u>rains</u>[^d] and the floods have I sent forth.
