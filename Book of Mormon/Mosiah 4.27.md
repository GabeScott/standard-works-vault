# Mosiah 4:27

> And see that all these things are done in wisdom and <u>order</u>[^a]; for it is not requisite that a man should run <u>faster</u>[^b] than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.
