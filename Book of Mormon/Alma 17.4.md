# Alma 17:4

> And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much <u>success</u>[^a] in bringing many to the <u>knowledge</u>[^b] of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and <u>confess</u>[^c] their sins before him.
