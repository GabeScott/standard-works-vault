# Helaman 8:7

> And it came to pass that thus they did <u>stir up</u>[^a] the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: <u>Let</u>[^b] this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;
