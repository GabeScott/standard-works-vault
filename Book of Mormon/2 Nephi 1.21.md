# 2 Nephi 1:21

> And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart might leave this world with gladness because of you, that I might not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, and be <u>men</u>[^a], and be determined in <u>one</u>[^b] mind and in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down into captivity;
