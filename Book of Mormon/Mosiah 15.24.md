# Mosiah 15:24

> And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having <u>salvation</u>[^a] declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.
