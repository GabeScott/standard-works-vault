# Alma 6:3

> And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not <u>repent</u>[^a] of their wickedness and humble themselves before God—I mean those who were lifted up in the <u>pride</u>[^b] of their hearts—the same were rejected, and their names were <u>blotted out</u>[^c], that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.
