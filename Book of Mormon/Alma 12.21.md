# Alma 12:21

> What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed <u>cherubim</u>[^a] and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of <u>Eden</u>[^b], lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.
