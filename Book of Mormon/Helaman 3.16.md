# Helaman 3:16

> And they have been <u>handed</u>[^a] down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and <u>scattered</u>[^b] upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are <u>no more</u>[^c] called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.
