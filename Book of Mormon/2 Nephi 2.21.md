# 2 Nephi 2:21

> And the days of the children of <u>men</u>[^a] were prolonged, according to the <u>will</u>[^b] of God, that they might <u>repent</u>[^c] while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of <u>probation</u>[^d], and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were <u>lost</u>[^e], because of the transgression of their parents.
