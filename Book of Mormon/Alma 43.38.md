# Alma 43:38

> While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their <u>breastplates</u>[^a], and their armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites.
