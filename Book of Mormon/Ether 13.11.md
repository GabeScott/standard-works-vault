# Ether 13:11

> And then also cometh the <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a] of old; and the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the <u>north</u>[^b] countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with their father, <u>Abraham</u>[^c] .
