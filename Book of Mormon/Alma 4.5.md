# Alma 4:5

> And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the <u>church</u>[^a] of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.
