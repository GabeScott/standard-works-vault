# Ether 12:32

> And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the <u>mansions</u>[^a] of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent <u>hope</u>[^b]; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.
