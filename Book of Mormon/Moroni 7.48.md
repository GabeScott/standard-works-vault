# Moroni 7:48

> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, <u>pray</u>[^a] unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true <u>followers</u>[^b] of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall <u>be</u>[^c] like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be <u>purified</u>[^d] even as he is pure. Amen.
