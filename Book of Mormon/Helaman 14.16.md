# Helaman 14:16

> Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the <u>resurrection</u>[^a], and <u>redeemeth</u>[^b] all mankind from the first deathâ€”that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the <u>fall</u>[^c] of Adam being <u>cut off</u>[^d] from the presence of the Lord, are considered as <u>dead</u>[^e], both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.
