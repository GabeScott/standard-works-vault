# Alma 24:18

> And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they <u>never</u>[^a] would use weapons again for the shedding of man’s blood; and this they did, vouching and <u>covenanting</u>[^b] with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would <u>give</u>[^c] up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.
