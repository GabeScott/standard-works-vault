# Mosiah 4:21

> And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to <u>impart</u>[^a] of the substance that ye have one to another.
