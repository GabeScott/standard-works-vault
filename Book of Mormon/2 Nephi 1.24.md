# 2 Nephi 1:24

> Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been <u>glorious</u>[^a], and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we must have perished with <u>hunger</u>[^b] in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to <u>take away</u>[^c] his life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.
