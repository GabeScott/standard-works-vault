# Ether 12:27

> And if men come unto me I will show unto them their <u>weakness</u>[^a] . I <u>give</u>[^b] unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my <u>grace</u>[^c] is sufficient for all men that <u>humble</u>[^d] themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make <u>weak</u>[^e] things become strong unto them.
