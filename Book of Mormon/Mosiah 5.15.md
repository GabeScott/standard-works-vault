> Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in <u>good works</u>[^a], that Christ, the <u>Lord God Omnipotent</u>[^b], may <u>seal</u>[^c] you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who <u>created</u>[^d] all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.
