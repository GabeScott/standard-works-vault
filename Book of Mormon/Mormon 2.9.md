# Mormon 2:9

> And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was <u>Aaron</u>[^a]; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And behold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand. And it came to pass that I beat him with my army that he fled before me. And behold, all this was done, and three hundred and thirty years had passed away.
