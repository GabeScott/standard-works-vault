# 2 Nephi 26:15

> After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have <u>dwindled</u>[^a] in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God shall have <u>camped</u>[^b] against them round about, and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the <u>prayers</u>[^c] of the faithful shall be heard, and all those who have <u>dwindled</u>[^d] in unbelief shall not be forgotten.
