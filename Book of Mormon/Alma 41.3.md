# Alma 41:3

> And it is requisite with the <u>justice</u>[^a] of God that men should be <u>judged</u>[^b] according to their <u>works</u>[^c]; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be <u>restored</u>[^d] unto that which is good.
