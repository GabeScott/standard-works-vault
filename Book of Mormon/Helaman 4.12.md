# Helaman 4:12

> And it was because of the <u>pride</u>[^a] of their hearts, because of their exceeding <u>riches</u>[^b], yea, it was because of their oppression to the <u>poor</u>[^c], withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a <u>mock</u>[^d] of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanitesâ€”
