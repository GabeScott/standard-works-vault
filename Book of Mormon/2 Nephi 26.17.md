# 2 Nephi 26:17

> For thus saith the Lord God: They shall <u>write</u>[^a] the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and <u>sealed</u>[^b] up in a book, and those who have dwindled in <u>unbelief</u>[^c] shall not have them, for they <u>seek</u>[^d] to destroy the things of God.
