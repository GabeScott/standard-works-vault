# Alma 21:4

> And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in their <u>synagogues</u>[^a], for they had built synagogues after the <u>order</u>[^b] of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.
