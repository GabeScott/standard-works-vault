# Alma 12:26

> And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the <u>tree of life</u>[^a] they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the <u>plan of redemption</u>[^b] would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.
