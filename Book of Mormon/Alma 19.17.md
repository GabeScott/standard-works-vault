# Alma 19:17

> Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it <u>known</u>[^a], therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had <u>fallen</u>[^b] to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay <u>prostrate</u>[^c] upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would <u>cause</u>[^d] them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.
