# Alma 32:3

> Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as <u>dross</u>[^a]; therefore they were <u>poor</u>[^b] as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.
