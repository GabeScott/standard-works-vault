# 4 Nephi 1:30

> Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast them into <u>prison</u>[^a]; but by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth doing mighty miracles among them.
