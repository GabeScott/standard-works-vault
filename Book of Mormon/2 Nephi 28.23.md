# 2 Nephi 28:23

> Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be <u>judged</u>[^a] according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a <u>lake</u>[^b] of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
