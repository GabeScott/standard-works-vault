# Alma 12:9

> And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to <u>know</u>[^a] the <u>mysteries</u>[^b] of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart <u>only</u>[^c] according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.
