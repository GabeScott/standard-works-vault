# Alma 26:29

> And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their <u>synagogues</u>[^a] and taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been <u>stoned</u>[^b], and taken and bound with <u>strong</u>[^c] cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.
