# 3 Nephi 24:1

> And it came to pass that he commanded them that they should write the words which the Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them. And it came to pass that after they were written he expounded them. And these are the words which he did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father unto Malachi—Behold, I will <u>send</u>[^a] my <u>messenger</u>[^b], and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly <u>come</u>[^c] to his temple, even the <u>messenger</u>[^d] of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.
