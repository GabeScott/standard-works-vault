# 2 Nephi 1:27

> And it must needs be that the <u>power</u>[^a] of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But behold, it was not he, but it was the <u>Spirit</u>[^b] of the Lord which was in him, which <u>opened</u>[^c] his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.
