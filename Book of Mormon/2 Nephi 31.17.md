# 2 Nephi 31:17

> Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and <u>baptism</u>[^a] by water; and then cometh a <u>remission</u>[^b] of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
