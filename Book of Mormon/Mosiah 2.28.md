# Mosiah 2:28

> I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might <u>rid</u>[^a] my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal <u>spirit</u>[^b] may join the <u>choirs</u>[^c] above in singing the praises of a just God.
