# Helaman 3:36

> And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great <u>riches</u>[^a] and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.
