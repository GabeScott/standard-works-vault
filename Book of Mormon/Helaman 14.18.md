# Helaman 14:18

> Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not <u>hewn</u>[^a] down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a <u>spiritual death</u>[^b], yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.
