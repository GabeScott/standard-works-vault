# Alma 27:25

> Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his <u>conversion</u>[^a], with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.
