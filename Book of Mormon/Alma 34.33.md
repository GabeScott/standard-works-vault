# Alma 34:33

> And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many <u>witnesses</u>[^a], therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not <u>procrastinate</u>[^b] the day of your <u>repentance</u>[^c] until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the <u>night</u>[^d] of <u>darkness</u>[^e] wherein there can be no labor performed.
