# 3 Nephi 12:2

> And again, more blessed are they who shall <u>believe</u>[^a] in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall <u>believe</u>[^b] in your <u>words</u>[^c], and <u>come</u>[^d] down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited <u>with</u>[^e] fire and with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.
