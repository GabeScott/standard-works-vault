# 3 Nephi 16:4

> And I command you that ye shall <u>write</u>[^a] these sayings after I am gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they who have seen me and been with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes whom they know not of, that these sayings which ye shall write shall be kept and shall be manifested unto the <u>Gentiles</u>[^b], that through the fulness of the Gentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of their <u>unbelief</u>[^c], may be brought in, or may be brought to a <u>knowledge</u>[^d] of me, their Redeemer.
