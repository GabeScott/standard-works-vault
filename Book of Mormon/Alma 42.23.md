# Alma 42:23

> But God ceaseth not to be God, and <u>mercy</u>[^a] claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the <u>atonement</u>[^b]; and the atonement bringeth to pass the <u>resurrection</u>[^c] of the dead; and the <u>resurrection</u>[^d] of the dead bringeth <u>back</u>[^e] men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be <u>judged</u>[^f] according to their works, according to the law and justice.
