# Alma 30:29

> Now when the high priest and the <u>chief judge</u>[^a] saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would <u>revile</u>[^b] even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.
