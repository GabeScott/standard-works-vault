# 1 Nephi 2:4

> And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and <u>departed</u>[^a] into the wilderness.
