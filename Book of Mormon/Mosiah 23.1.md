# Mosiah 23:1

> Now Alma, having been <u>warned</u>[^a] of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and <u>departed</u>[^b] into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.
