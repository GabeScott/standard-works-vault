# Mosiah 27:29

> My soul hath been <u>redeemed</u>[^a] from the gall of bitterness and <u>bonds</u>[^b] of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was <u>racked</u>[^c] with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is <u>pained</u>[^d] no more.
