# Jacob 5:7

> And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he said unto his <u>servant</u>[^a] : It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a <u>wild</u>[^b] olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire that they may be burned.
