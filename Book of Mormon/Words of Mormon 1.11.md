# Words of Mormon 1:11

> And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into <u>my hands</u>[^a] . And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which <u>my</u>[^b] people and their brethren shall be <u>judged</u>[^c] at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.
