# 1 Nephi 1:16

> And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in <u>visions</u>[^a] and in <u>dreams</u>[^b]; and he also hath written many things which he <u>prophesied</u>[^c] and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.
