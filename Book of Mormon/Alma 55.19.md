# Alma 55:19

> But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not <u>delight</u>[^a] in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.
