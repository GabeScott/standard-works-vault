# Helaman 5:23

> And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about <u>as</u>[^a] if by <u>fire</u>[^b], even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.
