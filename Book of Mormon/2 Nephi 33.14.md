# 2 Nephi 33:14

> And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the <u>Jews</u>[^a], and also my <u>words</u>[^b], and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall <u>condemn</u>[^c] you at the last day.
