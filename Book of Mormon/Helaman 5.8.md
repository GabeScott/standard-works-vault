# Helaman 5:8

> And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a <u>treasure</u>[^a] in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that <u>precious</u>[^b] gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.
