# 1 Nephi 13:5

> And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a <u>church</u>[^a] which is most abominable above all other churches, which <u>slayeth</u>[^b] the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a <u>yoke</u>[^c] of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity.
