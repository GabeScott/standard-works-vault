# Alma 37:9

> Yea, I say unto you, <u>were</u>[^a] it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have <u>convinced</u>[^b] so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their <u>words</u>[^c] brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.
