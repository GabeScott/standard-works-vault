# Alma 12:6

> And behold I say unto you all that this was a <u>snare</u>[^a] of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his <u>chains</u>[^b], that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.
