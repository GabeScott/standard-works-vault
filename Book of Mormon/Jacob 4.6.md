# Jacob 4:6

> Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of <u>prophecy</u>[^a]; and having all these <u>witnesses</u>[^b] we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can <u>command</u>[^c] in the <u>name</u>[^d] of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.
