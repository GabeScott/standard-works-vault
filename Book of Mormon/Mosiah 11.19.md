# Mosiah 11:19

> And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did <u>boast</u>[^a] in their own strength, saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of the wickedness of their king and priests.
