# 1 Nephi 19:2

> And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make <u>these plates</u>[^a]; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made <u>these plates</u>[^b] are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates.
