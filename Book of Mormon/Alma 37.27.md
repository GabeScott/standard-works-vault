> And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their <u>signs</u>[^a] and their wonders ye shall <u>keep</u>[^b] from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.
