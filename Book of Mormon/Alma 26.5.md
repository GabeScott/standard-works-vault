# Alma 26:5

> Behold, the <u>field</u>[^a] was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the <u>sickle</u>[^b], and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your <u>sheaves</u>[^c] ! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.
