# Alma 5:52

> And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the <u>ax</u>[^a] is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be <u>hewn</u>[^b] down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.
