# 2 Nephi 25:12

> But, behold, they shall have <u>wars</u>[^a], and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the <u>Only Begotten</u>[^b] of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall <u>manifest</u>[^c] himself unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks.
