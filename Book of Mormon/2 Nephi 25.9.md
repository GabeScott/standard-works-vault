# 2 Nephi 25:9

> And as one generation hath been <u>destroyed</u>[^a] among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were <u>foretold</u>[^b] them by the prophets of the Lord.
