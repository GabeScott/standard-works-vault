# Alma 26:1

> And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we <u>started</u>[^a] from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?
