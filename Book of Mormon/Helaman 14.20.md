# Helaman 14:20

> But behold, as I said unto you concerning another <u>sign</u>[^a], a sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his <u>light</u>[^b] unto you; and also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon the face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of <u>three</u>[^c] days, to the time that he shall rise again from the dead.
