# Ether 12:24

> And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the <u>awkwardness</u>[^a] of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in <u>writing</u>[^b] like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he <u>wrote</u>[^c] were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.
