# Helaman 7:21

> But behold, it is to get <u>gain</u>[^a], to be <u>praised</u>[^b] of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the <u>riches</u>[^c] and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear <u>false witness</u>[^d] against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.
