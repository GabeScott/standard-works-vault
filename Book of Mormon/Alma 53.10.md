# Alma 53:10

> And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the <u>people</u>[^a] of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been <u>converted</u>[^b] unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.
