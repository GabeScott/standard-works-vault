# Alma 32:12

> I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn <u>wisdom</u>[^a]; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding <u>poverty</u>[^b], that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.
