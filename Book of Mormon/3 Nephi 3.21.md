# 3 Nephi 3:21

> But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord <u>forbid</u>[^a]; for if we should go up against them the Lord would <u>deliver</u>[^b] us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.
