# Alma 36:2

> I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in <u>bondage</u>[^a], and none could <u>deliver</u>[^b] them except it was the <u>God</u>[^c] of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.
