# Mosiah 29:36

> Yea, all <u>his</u>[^a] iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which cannot be enumeratedâ€”telling them that these things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.
