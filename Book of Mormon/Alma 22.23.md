# Alma 22:23

> Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to <u>minister</u>[^a] unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his <u>whole</u>[^b] household were <u>converted</u>[^c] unto the Lord.
