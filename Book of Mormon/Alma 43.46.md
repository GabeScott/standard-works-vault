# Alma 43:46

> And they were doing that which they felt was the <u>duty</u>[^a] which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: <u>Inasmuch</u>[^b] as ye are not guilty of the <u>first</u>[^c] offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.
