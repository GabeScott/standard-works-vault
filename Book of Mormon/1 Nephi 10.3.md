> That after they should be destroyed, even that great city <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a], and many be <u>carried away</u>[^b] captive into <u>Babylon</u>[^c], according to the own due time of the Lord, they should <u>return</u>[^d] again, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they should be brought back out of captivity they should possess again the land of their inheritance.
