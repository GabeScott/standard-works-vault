# Enos 1:13

> And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him—that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be <u>destroyed</u>[^a], and the Lamanites should not be <u>destroyed</u>[^b], that the Lord God would <u>preserve</u>[^c] a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be <u>brought forth</u>[^d] at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be <u>brought</u>[^e] unto salvation—
