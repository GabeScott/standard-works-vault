# Alma 33:1

> Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in <u>one God</u>[^a], that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or <u>how</u>[^b] they should plant the <u>seed</u>[^c], or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.
