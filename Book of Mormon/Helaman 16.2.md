# Helaman 16:2

> But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were <u>angry</u>[^a] with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.
