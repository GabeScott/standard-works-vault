# Mosiah 12:2

> Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to pass that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into <u>bondage</u>[^a], and shall be smitten on the <u>cheek</u>[^b]; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their <u>flesh</u>[^c] .
