# Ether 8:22

> And whatsoever <u>nation</u>[^a] shall uphold such secret combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the <u>blood</u>[^b] of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for <u>vengeance</u>[^c] upon them and yet he avenge them not.
