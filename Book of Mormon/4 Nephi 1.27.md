# 4 Nephi 1:27

> And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had passed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did <u>deny</u>[^a] the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had been <u>forbidden</u>[^b] because of unworthiness.
