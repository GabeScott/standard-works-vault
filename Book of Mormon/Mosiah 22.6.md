# Mosiah 22:6

> Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the <u>guards</u>[^a] of the Lamanites, by night are <u>drunken</u>[^b]; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.
