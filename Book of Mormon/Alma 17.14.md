# Alma 17:14

> And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a <u>wild</u>[^a] and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.
