# 2 Nephi 25:10

> Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them, immediately after my father left <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a]; nevertheless, they <u>hardened</u>[^b] their hearts; and according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those which are <u>carried away</u>[^c] <u>captive</u>[^d] into Babylon.
