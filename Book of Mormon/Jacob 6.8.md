# Jacob 6:8

> Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye reject the words of the <u>prophets</u>[^a]; and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning him; and <u>deny</u>[^b] the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and the <u>gift</u>[^c] of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a <u>mock</u>[^d] of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you?
