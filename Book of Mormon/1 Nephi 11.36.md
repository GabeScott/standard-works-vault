# 1 Nephi 11:36

> And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the <u>pride</u>[^a] of the world; and it <u>fell</u>[^b], and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
