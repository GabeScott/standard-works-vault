# Mosiah 13:3

> <u>Touch me not</u>[^a], for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye <u>requested</u>[^b] that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time.
