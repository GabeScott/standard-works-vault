# 4 Nephi 1:34

> Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they were led by many priests and <u>false prophets</u>[^a] to build up many churches, and to do all manner of iniquity. And they did <u>smite</u>[^b] upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had passed away.
