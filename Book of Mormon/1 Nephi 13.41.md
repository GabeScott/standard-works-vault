# 1 Nephi 13:41

> And they must come according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the <u>records</u>[^a] of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both shall be established in <u>one</u>[^b]; for there is <u>one God</u>[^c] and one <u>Shepherd</u>[^d] over all the earth.
