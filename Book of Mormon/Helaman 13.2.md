# Helaman 13:2

> And it came to pass that in this year there was one <u>Samuel</u>[^a], a <u>Lamanite</u>[^b], came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people. And it came to pass that he did preach, many days, repentance unto the people, and they did <u>cast</u>[^c] him out, and he was about to <u>return</u>[^d] to his own land.
