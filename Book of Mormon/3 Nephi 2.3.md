# 3 Nephi 2:3

> And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did <u>go</u>[^a] about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.
