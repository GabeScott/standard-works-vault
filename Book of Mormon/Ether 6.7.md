# Ether 6:7

> And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being <u>tight</u>[^a] like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the <u>ark</u>[^b] of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.
