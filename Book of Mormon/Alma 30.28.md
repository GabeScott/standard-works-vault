# Alma 30:28

> Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who <u>never</u>[^a] has been seen or known, who <u>never</u>[^b] was nor ever will be.
