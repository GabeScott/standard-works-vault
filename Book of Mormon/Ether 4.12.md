# Ether 4:12

> And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for <u>good</u>[^a] cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good; he that will <u>not believe</u>[^b] my words will not believe meâ€”that I am; and he that will not believe me will not believe the Father who sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the <u>light</u>[^c], and the <u>life</u>[^d], and the <u>truth</u>[^e] of the world.
