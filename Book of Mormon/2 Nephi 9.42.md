# 2 Nephi 9:42

> And whoso <u>knocketh</u>[^a], to him will he open; and the <u>wise</u>[^b], and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their <u>learning</u>[^c], and their <u>wisdom</u>[^d], and their riches—yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves <u>fools</u>[^e] before God, and come down in the depths of <u>humility</u>[^f], he will not open unto them.
