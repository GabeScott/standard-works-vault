# Mosiah 4:6

> I say unto you, if ye have come to a <u>knowledge</u>[^a] of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the <u>atonement</u>[^b] which has been prepared from the <u>foundation</u>[^c] of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his <u>trust</u>[^d] in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal bodyâ€”
