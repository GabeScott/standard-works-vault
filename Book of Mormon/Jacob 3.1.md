# Jacob 3:1

> But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and <u>pray</u>[^a] unto him with exceeding faith, and he will <u>console</u>[^b] you in your <u>afflictions</u>[^c], and he will plead your cause, and send down <u>justice</u>[^d] upon those who seek your destruction.
