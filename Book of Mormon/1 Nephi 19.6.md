# 1 Nephi 19:6

> Nevertheless, I do not <u>write</u>[^a] anything upon plates save it be that I think it be <u>sacred</u>[^b] . And now, if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because of the <u>weakness</u>[^c] which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.
