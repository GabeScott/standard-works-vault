> And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people <u>gathered</u>[^a] themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the <u>temple</u>[^b] to <u>hear</u>[^c] the <u>words</u>[^d] which king Benjamin should speak unto them.
