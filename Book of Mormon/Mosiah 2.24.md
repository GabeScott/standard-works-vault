# Mosiah 2:24

> And secondly, he doth <u>require</u>[^a] that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately <u>bless</u>[^b] you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?
