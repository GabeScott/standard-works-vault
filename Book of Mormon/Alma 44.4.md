# Alma 44:4

> Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are <u>faithful</u>[^a] unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.
