# Alma 43:9

> And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their <u>wives</u>[^a], and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their <u>rights</u>[^b] and their privileges, yea, and also their <u>liberty</u>[^c], that they might worship God according to their desires.
