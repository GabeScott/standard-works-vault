# 3 Nephi 22:1

> And then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O <u>barren</u>[^a], thou that didst not bear; break forth into <u>singing</u>[^b], and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the <u>desolate</u>[^c] than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.
