# 3 Nephi 27:32

> But behold, it <u>sorroweth</u>[^a] me because of the <u>fourth</u>[^b] generation from this generation, for they are led away captive by him even as was the <u>son of perdition</u>[^c]; for they will sell me for silver and for gold, and for that which <u>moth</u>[^d] doth corrupt and which thieves can break through and steal. And in that day will I visit them, even in turning their works upon their own heads.
