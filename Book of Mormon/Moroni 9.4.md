# Moroni 9:4

> Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of God with <u>sharpness</u>[^a] they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they <u>harden</u>[^b] their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased <u>striving</u>[^c] with them.
