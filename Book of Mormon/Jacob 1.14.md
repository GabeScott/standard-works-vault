# Jacob 1:14

> But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish <u>them</u>[^a] by these names, but I shall <u>call</u>[^b] them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call <u>Nephites</u>[^c], or the <u>people</u>[^d] of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.
