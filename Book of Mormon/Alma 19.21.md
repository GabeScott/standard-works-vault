# Alma 19:21

> And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters of Sebus and <u>scattered</u>[^a] the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.
