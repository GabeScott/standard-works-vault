# Mosiah 26:6

> For it came to pass that they did <u>deceive</u>[^a] many with their <u>flattering</u>[^b] words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be <u>admonished</u>[^c] by the church.
