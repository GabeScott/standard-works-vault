# Enos 1:20

> And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to <u>restore</u>[^a] the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our <u>labors</u>[^b] were vain; their <u>hatred</u>[^c] was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a <u>blood-thirsty</u>[^d] people, full of <u>idolatry</u>[^e] and <u>filthiness</u>[^f]; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in <u>tents</u>[^g], and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the <u>bow</u>[^h], and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.
