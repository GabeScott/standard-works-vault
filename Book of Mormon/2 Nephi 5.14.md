# 2 Nephi 5:14

> And I, Nephi, did take the <u>sword</u>[^a] of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many <u>swords</u>[^b], lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their <u>hatred</u>[^c] towards me and my children and those who were called my people.
