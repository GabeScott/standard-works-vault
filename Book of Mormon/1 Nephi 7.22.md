# 1 Nephi 7:22

> And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give <u>thanks</u>[^a] unto the Lord their God; and they did offer <u>sacrifice</u>[^b] and burnt offerings unto him.
