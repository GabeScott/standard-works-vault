# Mosiah 1:13

> Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into <u>transgression</u>[^a], and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become <u>weak</u>[^b] like unto their brethren; and he will no more <u>preserve</u>[^c] them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.
