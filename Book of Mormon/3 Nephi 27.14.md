# 3 Nephi 27:14

> And my Father sent me that I might be <u>lifted up</u>[^a] upon the <u>cross</u>[^b]; and after that I had been lifted up upon the <u>cross</u>[^c], that I might <u>draw</u>[^d] all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be <u>judged</u>[^e] of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evilâ€”
