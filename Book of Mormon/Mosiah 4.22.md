# Mosiah 4:22

> And if ye <u>judge</u>[^a] the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your <u>condemnation</u>[^b] for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life <u>belongeth</u>[^c]; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.
