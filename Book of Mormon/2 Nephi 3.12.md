# 2 Nephi 3:12

> Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall <u>write</u>[^a]; and the fruit of the loins of <u>Judah</u>[^b] shall <u>write</u>[^c]; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the <u>confounding</u>[^d] of <u>false doctrines</u>[^e] and laying down of contentions, and establishing <u>peace</u>[^f] among the fruit of thy loins, and <u>bringing</u>[^g] them to the <u>knowledge</u>[^h] of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.
