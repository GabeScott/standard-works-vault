# Moroni 10:27

> And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my <u>words</u>[^a] unto you, which were written by this man, like as one <u>crying</u>[^b] from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the <u>dust</u>[^c] ?
