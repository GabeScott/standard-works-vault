# Mosiah 2:22

> And behold, all that he <u>requires</u>[^a] of you is to <u>keep</u>[^b] his commandments; and he has <u>promised</u>[^c] you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth <u>vary</u>[^d] from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do <u>keep</u>[^e] his <u>commandments</u>[^f] he doth bless you and prosper you.
