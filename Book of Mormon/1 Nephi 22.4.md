# 1 Nephi 22:4

> And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the <u>tribes</u>[^a] have been <u>led away</u>[^b]; and they are <u>scattered</u>[^c] to and fro upon the <u>isles</u>[^d] of the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.
