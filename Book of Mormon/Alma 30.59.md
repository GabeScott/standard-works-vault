# Alma 30:59

> And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves <u>Zoramites</u>[^a], being led by a man whose name was Zoramâ€”and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was <u>dead</u>[^b] .
