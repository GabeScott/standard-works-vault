# 2 Nephi 1:9

> Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a <u>promise</u>[^a], that <u>inasmuch</u>[^b] as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall <u>prosper</u>[^c] upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall <u>keep</u>[^d] his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their <u>inheritance</u>[^e]; and they shall dwell safely forever.
