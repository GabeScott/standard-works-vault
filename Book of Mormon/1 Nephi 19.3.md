# 1 Nephi 19:3

> And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon <u>these plates</u>[^a]; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other <u>wise</u>[^b] purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord.
