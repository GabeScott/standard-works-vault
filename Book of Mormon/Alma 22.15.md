# Alma 22:15

> And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: <u>What</u>[^a] shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be <u>born of God</u>[^b], having this wicked spirit <u>rooted</u>[^c] out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up <u>all</u>[^d] that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.
