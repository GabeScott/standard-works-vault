# Ether 9:3

> And the Lord <u>warned</u>[^a] Omer in a dream that he should depart out of the land; wherefore Omer <u>departed</u>[^b] out of the land with his family, and traveled many days, and came over and passed by the hill of <u>Shim</u>[^c], and came over by the place <u>where</u>[^d] the Nephites were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which was called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared and his family.
