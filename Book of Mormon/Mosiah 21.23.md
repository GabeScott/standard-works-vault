# Mosiah 21:23

> And the king having been without the gates of the city with his guard, <u>discovered</u>[^a] Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be taken, and bound, and cast into <u>prison</u>[^b] . And had they been the priests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to death.
