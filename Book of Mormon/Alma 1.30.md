# Alma 1:30

> And thus, in their <u>prosperous</u>[^a] circumstances, they did not send away any who were <u>naked</u>[^b], or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon <u>riches</u>[^c]; therefore they were <u>liberal</u>[^d] to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no <u>respect</u>[^e] to persons as to those who stood in need.
