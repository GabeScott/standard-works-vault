# 2 Nephi 5:3

> Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to <u>rule</u>[^a] over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to <u>rule</u>[^b] over this people.
