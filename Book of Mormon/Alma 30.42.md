# Alma 30:42

> Behold, I know that thou <u>believest</u>[^a], but thou art possessed with a <u>lying</u>[^b] spirit, and ye have put <u>off</u>[^c] the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.
