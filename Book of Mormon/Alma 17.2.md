# Alma 17:2

> Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel <u>first</u>[^a] appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had <u>searched</u>[^b] the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.
