# Ether 2:14

> And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and <u>talked</u>[^a] with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and <u>chastened</u>[^b] him because he remembered not to <u>call</u>[^c] upon the name of the Lord.
