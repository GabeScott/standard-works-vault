# Mormon 8:31

> Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great <u>pollutions</u>[^a] upon the face of the earth; there shall be <u>murders</u>[^b], and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do this, or do that, and it <u>mattereth</u>[^c] not, for the Lord will <u>uphold</u>[^d] such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the <u>gall of bitterness</u>[^e] and in the <u>bonds</u>[^f] of iniquity.
