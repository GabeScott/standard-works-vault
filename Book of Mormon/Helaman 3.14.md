# Helaman 3:14

> But behold, a <u>hundredth</u>[^a] part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of <u>temples</u>[^b], and of synagogues and their <u>sanctuaries</u>[^c], and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.
