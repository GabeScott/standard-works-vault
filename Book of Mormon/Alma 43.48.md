# Alma 43:48

> And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughtsâ€”yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage.
