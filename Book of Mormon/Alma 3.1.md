# Alma 3:1

> And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not <u>slain</u>[^a] by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain—now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number—after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.
