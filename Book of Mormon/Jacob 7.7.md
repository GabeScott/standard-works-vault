# Jacob 7:7

> And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and <u>keep</u>[^a] not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is <u>blasphemy</u>[^b]; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot <u>tell</u>[^c] of things to come. And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.
