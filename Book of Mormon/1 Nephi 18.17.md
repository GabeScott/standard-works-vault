# 1 Nephi 18:17

> Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also unto the sons of <u>Ishmael</u>[^a]; but, behold, they did breathe out much threatenings against anyone that should speak for me; and my parents being <u>stricken</u>[^b] in years, and having <u>suffered</u>[^c] much grief because of their <u>children</u>[^d], they were brought down, yea, even upon their sick-beds.
