# 3 Nephi 28:9

> And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh, neither sorrow save it be for the <u>sins</u>[^a] of the world; and all this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of me, for ye have desired that ye might <u>bring</u>[^b] the souls of men unto me, while the world shall stand.
