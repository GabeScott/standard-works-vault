# 2 Nephi 9:16

> And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal <u>word</u>[^a], which cannot <u>pass away</u>[^b], that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are <u>filthy</u>[^c] shall be <u>filthy</u>[^d] still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the <u>devil</u>[^e] and his angels; and they shall go away into <u>everlasting</u>[^f] fire, prepared for them; and their <u>torment</u>[^g] is as a <u>lake</u>[^h] of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.
