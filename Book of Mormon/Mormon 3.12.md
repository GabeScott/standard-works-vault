# Mormon 3:12

> Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I had led them many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the <u>love</u>[^a] of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long for them; nevertheless, it was <u>without faith</u>[^b], because of the <u>hardness</u>[^c] of their hearts.
