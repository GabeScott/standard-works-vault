# 1 Nephi 15:20

> And I did rehearse unto them the words of <u>Isaiah</u>[^a], who spake <u>concerning</u>[^b] the <u>restoration</u>[^c] of the Jews, or of the house of Israel; and after they were restored they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did <u>humble</u>[^d] themselves before the Lord.
