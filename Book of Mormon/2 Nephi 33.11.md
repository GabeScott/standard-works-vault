# 2 Nephi 33:11

> And if they are not the words of Christ, judge yeâ€”for Christ will show unto you, with <u>power</u>[^a] and great <u>glory</u>[^b], that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.
