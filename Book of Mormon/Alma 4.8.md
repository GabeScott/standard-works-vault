# Alma 4:8

> For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their <u>hearts</u>[^a] upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did <u>not believe</u>[^b] according to their own will and pleasure.
