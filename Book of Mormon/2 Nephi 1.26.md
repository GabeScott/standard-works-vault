# 2 Nephi 1:26

> And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used <u>sharpness</u>[^a]; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his <u>sharpness</u>[^b] was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.
