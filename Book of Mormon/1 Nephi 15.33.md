# 1 Nephi 15:33

> Wherefore, if they should <u>die</u>[^a] in their wickedness they must be <u>cast off</u>[^b] also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God, to be <u>judged</u>[^c] of their <u>works</u>[^d]; and if their works have been filthiness they must needs be <u>filthy</u>[^e]; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot <u>dwell</u>[^f] in the kingdom of God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.
