# Mosiah 28:17

> Now after Mosiah had finished <u>translating</u>[^a] these <u>records</u>[^b], behold, it gave an account of the people who were <u>destroyed</u>[^c], from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the <u>great tower</u>[^d], at the time the Lord <u>confounded</u>[^e] the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.
