# Alma 47:35

> And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the <u>favor</u>[^a] of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his <u>fraud</u>[^b], and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he <u>obtained</u>[^c] the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were <u>composed</u>[^d] of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.
