# Mormon 2:15

> And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw that the <u>day</u>[^a] of <u>grace</u>[^b] <u>was passed</u>[^c] with them, both temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open <u>rebellion</u>[^d] against their God, and heaped up as <u>dung</u>[^e] upon the face of the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four years had passed away.
