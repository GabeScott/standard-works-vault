# 3 Nephi 8:19

> And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease—for behold, they did last for about the space of <u>three</u>[^a] <u>hours</u>[^b]; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours—and then behold, there was <u>darkness</u>[^c] upon the face of the land.
