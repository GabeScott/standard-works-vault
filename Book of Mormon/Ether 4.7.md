# Ether 4:7

> And in that day that they shall exercise <u>faith</u>[^a] in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become <u>sanctified</u>[^b] in me, then will I <u>manifest</u>[^c] unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my <u>revelations</u>[^d], saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the <u>Father</u>[^e] of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.
