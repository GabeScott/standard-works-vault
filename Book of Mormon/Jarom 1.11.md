# Jarom 1:11

> Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the <u>teachers</u>[^a], did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to <u>diligence</u>[^b]; teaching the <u>law</u>[^c] of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to <u>look</u>[^d] forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come <u>as</u>[^e] though he already was. And after this manner did they teach them.
