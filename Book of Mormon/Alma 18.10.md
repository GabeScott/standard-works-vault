# Alma 18:10

> Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his <u>chariots</u>[^a] he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.
