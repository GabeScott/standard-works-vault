# Alma 60:17

> But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking <u>possession</u>[^a] of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men.
