# Jacob 7:6

> And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the <u>gospel</u>[^a], or the doctrine of Christ.
