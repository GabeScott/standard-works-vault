# 1 Nephi 14:17

> And when the <u>day</u>[^a] cometh that the <u>wrath</u>[^b] of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the <u>work</u>[^c] of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his <u>covenants</u>[^d], which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.
