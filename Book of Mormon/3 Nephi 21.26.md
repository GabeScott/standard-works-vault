# 3 Nephi 21:26

> And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even <u>when</u>[^a] this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of <u>this people</u>[^b] . Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been <u>lost</u>[^c], which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.
