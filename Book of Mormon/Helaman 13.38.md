# Helaman 13:38

> But behold, your <u>days</u>[^a] of probation are past; ye have <u>procrastinated</u>[^b] the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for <u>happiness</u>[^c] in doing iniquity, which thing is <u>contrary</u>[^d] to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.
