# Alma 40:26

> But behold, an awful <u>death</u>[^a] cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and <u>no unclean thing</u>[^b] can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter <u>cup</u>[^c] .
