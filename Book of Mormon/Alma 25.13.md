# Alma 25:13

> And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of <u>Ishmael</u>[^a] and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of <u>Anti-Nephi-Lehi</u>[^b] .
