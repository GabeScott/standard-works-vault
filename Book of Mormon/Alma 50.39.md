# Alma 50:39

> Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and <u>governor</u>[^a] over the people, with an <u>oath</u>[^b] and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the <u>freedom</u>[^c] of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.
