# 2 Nephi 6:4

> And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of <u>Isaiah</u>[^a] . And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.
