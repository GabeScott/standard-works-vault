# Mosiah 9:14

> For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of <u>Shilom</u>[^a], when my people were watering and <u>feeding</u>[^b] their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.
