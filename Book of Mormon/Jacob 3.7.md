# Jacob 3:7

> Behold, their <u>husbands</u>[^a] <u>love</u>[^b] their <u>wives</u>[^c], and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their <u>unbelief</u>[^d] and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?
