# 1 Nephi 12:19

> And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the <u>temptations</u>[^a] of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did <u>overpower</u>[^b] the people of my seed.
