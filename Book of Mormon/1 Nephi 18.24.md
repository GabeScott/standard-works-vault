# 1 Nephi 18:24

> And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our <u>seeds</u>[^a] into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance.
