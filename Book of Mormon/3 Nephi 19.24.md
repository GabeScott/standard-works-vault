# 3 Nephi 19:24

> And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not <u>multiply</u>[^a] many words, for it was given unto them what they should <u>pray</u>[^b], and they were filled with desire.
