# 2 Nephi 2:5

> And men are instructed sufficiently that they <u>know</u>[^a] good from evil. And the <u>law</u>[^b] is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is <u>justified</u>[^c]; or, by the law men are <u>cut off</u>[^d] . Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
