# Mosiah 2:21

> I say unto you that if ye should <u>serve</u>[^a] him who has created you from the beginning, and is <u>preserving</u>[^b] you from day to day, by lending you <u>breath</u>[^c], that ye may live and move and do according to your own <u>will</u>[^d], and even supporting you from one moment to anotherâ€”I say, if ye should serve him with all your <u>whole</u>[^e] souls yet ye would be <u>unprofitable</u>[^f] servants.
