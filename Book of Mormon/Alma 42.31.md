# Alma 42:31

> And now, O my son, ye are called of God to <u>preach</u>[^a] the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest <u>bring</u>[^b] souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words. Amen.
