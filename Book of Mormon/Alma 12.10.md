# Alma 12:10

> And therefore, he that will <u>harden</u>[^a] his heart, the same receiveth the <u>lesser</u>[^b] portion of the word; and he that will <u>not</u>[^c] harden his heart, to him is <u>given</u>[^d] the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.
