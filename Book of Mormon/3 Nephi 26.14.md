# 3 Nephi 26:14

> And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the <u>children</u>[^a] of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did <u>loose</u>[^b] their <u>tongues</u>[^c], and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people; and he loosed their tongues that they could utter.
