# Alma 42:30

> O my son, I desire that ye should deny the <u>justice</u>[^a] of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his <u>mercy</u>[^b], and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in <u>humility</u>[^c] .
