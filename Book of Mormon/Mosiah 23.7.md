# Mosiah 23:7

> But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall <u>not</u>[^a] esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.
