# 3 Nephi 11:11

> And behold, I am the <u>light</u>[^a] and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter <u>cup</u>[^b] which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in <u>taking</u>[^c] upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the <u>will</u>[^d] of the Father in all things from the beginning.
