# Alma 60:32

> Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out in judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the <u>tradition</u>[^a] of their fathers that has caused their hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by those who have dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of glory and the vain things of the world?
