# 2 Nephi 28:22

> And behold, others he <u>flattereth</u>[^a] away, and telleth them there is no <u>hell</u>[^b]; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is noneâ€”and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful <u>chains</u>[^c], from whence there is no deliverance.
