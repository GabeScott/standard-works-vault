# Alma 49:23

> Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their <u>chief</u>[^a] captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.
