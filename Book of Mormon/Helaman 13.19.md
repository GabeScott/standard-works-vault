# Helaman 13:19

> For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their <u>treasures</u>[^a] unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.
