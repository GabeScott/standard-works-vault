# 1 Nephi 13:26

> And after they go forth by the <u>hand</u>[^a] of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews <u>unto</u>[^b] the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that <u>great</u>[^c] and abominable <u>church</u>[^d], which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have <u>taken</u>[^e] away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are <u>plain</u>[^f] and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.
