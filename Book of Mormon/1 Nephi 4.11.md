# 1 Nephi 4:11

> And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the <u>Lord</u>[^a] hath <u>delivered</u>[^b] him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had <u>taken</u>[^c] away our property.
