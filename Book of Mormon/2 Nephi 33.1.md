# 2 Nephi 33:1

> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I <u>mighty</u>[^a] in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man <u>speaketh</u>[^b] by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.
