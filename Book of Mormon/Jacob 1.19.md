# Jacob 1:19

> And we did <u>magnify</u>[^a] our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the <u>responsibility</u>[^b], answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not <u>teach</u>[^c] them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their <u>blood</u>[^d] might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.
