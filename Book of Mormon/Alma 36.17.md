# Alma 36:17

> And it came to pass that as I was thus <u>racked</u>[^a] with torment, while I was <u>harrowed up</u>[^b] by the <u>memory</u>[^c] of my many sins, behold, I <u>remembered</u>[^d] also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.
