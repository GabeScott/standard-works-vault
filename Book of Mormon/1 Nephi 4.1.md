# 1 Nephi 4:1

> And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be <u>faithful</u>[^a] in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not <u>mightier</u>[^b] than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?
