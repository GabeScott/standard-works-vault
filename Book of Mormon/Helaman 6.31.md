# Helaman 6:31

> And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the <u>way</u>[^a] of righteousness, and did <u>trample</u>[^b] under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves <u>idols</u>[^c] of their gold and their silver.
