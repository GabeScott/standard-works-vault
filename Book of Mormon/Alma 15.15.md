# Alma 15:15

> But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, <u>ascribing</u>[^a] all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of <u>Nehor</u>[^b], and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.
