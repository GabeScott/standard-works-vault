# Alma 8:31

> And they had <u>power</u>[^a] given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their <u>power</u>[^b] until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.
