# Alma 31:1

> Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to <u>bow</u>[^a] down to dumb <u>idols</u>[^b], his heart again began to <u>sicken</u>[^c] because of the iniquity of the people.
