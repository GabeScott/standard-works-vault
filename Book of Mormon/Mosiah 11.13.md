# Mosiah 11:13

> And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the <u>hill</u>[^a] north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they <u>fled</u>[^b] out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.
