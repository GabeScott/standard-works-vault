# Mosiah 7:19

> Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your <u>trust</u>[^a] in <u>God</u>[^b], in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who <u>brought</u>[^c] the children of <u>Israel</u>[^d] out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the <u>Red Sea</u>[^e] on dry ground, and fed them with <u>manna</u>[^f] that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.
