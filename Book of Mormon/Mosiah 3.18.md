# Mosiah 3:18

> For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink <u>damnation</u>[^a] to their own souls except they humble themselves and <u>become</u>[^b] as little children, and believe that <u>salvation</u>[^c] was, and is, and is to come, in and through the <u>atoning</u>[^d] blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.
