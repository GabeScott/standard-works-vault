# Helaman 6:28

> And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of the people to <u>build</u>[^a] a tower sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it was that same being who led on the people who came from that tower into this land; who spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he dragged the people down to an <u>entire</u>[^b] destruction, and to an everlasting hell.
