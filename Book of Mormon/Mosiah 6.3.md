# Mosiah 6:3

> And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son <u>Mosiah</u>[^a] to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had <u>appointed</u>[^b] <u>priests</u>[^c] to <u>teach</u>[^d] the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the <u>oath</u>[^e] which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their <u>families</u>[^f], to their own houses.
