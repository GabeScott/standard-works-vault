> Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small <u>forts</u>[^a], or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building <u>walls</u>[^b] of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.
