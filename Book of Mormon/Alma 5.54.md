# Alma 5:54

> Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having been <u>sanctified</u>[^a] by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works which are meet for repentanceâ€”
