# Ether 12:20

> And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his <u>finger</u>[^a] he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.
