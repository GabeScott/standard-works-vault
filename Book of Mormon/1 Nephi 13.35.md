# 1 Nephi 13:35

> For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren, behold, <u>these things</u>[^a] shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.
