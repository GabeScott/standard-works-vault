# Alma 11:44

> Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be <u>restored</u>[^a] to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the <u>Father</u>[^b], and the Holy Spirit, which is <u>one Eternal God</u>[^c], to be <u>judged</u>[^d] according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.
