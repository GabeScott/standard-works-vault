# Alma 20:24

> Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in <u>whatsoever</u>[^a] thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.
