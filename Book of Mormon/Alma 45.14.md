# Alma 45:14

> But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be <u>numbered</u>[^a] among the <u>Lamanites</u>[^b], and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even <u>until</u>[^c] they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.
