# 1 Nephi 16:29

> And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us <u>understanding</u>[^a] concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it. And thus we see that by <u>small</u>[^b] means the Lord can bring about great things.
