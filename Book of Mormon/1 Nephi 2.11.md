# 1 Nephi 2:11

> Now this he spake because of the <u>stiffneckedness</u>[^a] of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did <u>murmur</u>[^b] in many things against their <u>father</u>[^c], because he was a <u>visionary</u>[^d] man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
