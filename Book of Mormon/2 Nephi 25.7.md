# 2 Nephi 25:7

> But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my <u>plainness</u>[^a]; in the which I <u>know</u>[^b] that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.
