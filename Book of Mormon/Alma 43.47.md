# Alma 43:47

> And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall <u>defend</u>[^a] your families even unto <u>bloodshed</u>[^b] . Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.
