# 2 Nephi 26:10

> And when these things have passed away a speedy <u>destruction</u>[^a] cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their <u>foolishness</u>[^b] they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and <u>choose</u>[^c] works of <u>darkness</u>[^d] rather than light, therefore they must go down to <u>hell</u>[^e] .
