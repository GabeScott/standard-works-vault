# 1 Nephi 14:12

> And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were <u>few</u>[^a], because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon <u>all</u>[^b] the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.
