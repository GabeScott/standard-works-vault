# Ether 8:26

> Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have <u>no power</u>[^a] upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be <u>persuaded</u>[^b] to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all <u>righteousness</u>[^c] and be saved.
