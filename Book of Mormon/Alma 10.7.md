# Alma 10:7

> As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an <u>angel</u>[^a] of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has <u>fasted</u>[^b] many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt <u>receive</u>[^c] him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.
