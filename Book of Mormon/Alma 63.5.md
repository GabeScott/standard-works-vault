# Alma 63:5

> And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an <u>exceedingly</u>[^a] curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land <u>Bountiful</u>[^b], by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the <u>narrow</u>[^c] neck which led into the land northward.
