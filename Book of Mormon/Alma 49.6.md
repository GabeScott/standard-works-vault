# Alma 49:6

> Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with <u>breastplates</u>[^a]; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.
