# 1 Nephi 15:13

> And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have <u>dwindled</u>[^a] in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations after the <u>Messiah</u>[^b] shall be manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall the fulness of the <u>gospel</u>[^c] of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the <u>Gentiles</u>[^d] unto the remnant of our seedâ€”
