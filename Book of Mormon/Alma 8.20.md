# Alma 8:20

> And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an <u>angel</u>[^a] said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my <u>food</u>[^b]; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.
