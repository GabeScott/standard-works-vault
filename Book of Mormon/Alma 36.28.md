# Alma 36:28

> And I know that he will <u>raise</u>[^a] me up at the last day, to dwell with him in <u>glory</u>[^b]; yea, and I will <u>praise</u>[^c] him forever, for he has <u>brought</u>[^d] our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the <u>Egyptians</u>[^e] in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.
