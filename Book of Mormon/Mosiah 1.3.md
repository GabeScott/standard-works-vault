# Mosiah 1:3

> And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the <u>plates of brass</u>[^a], saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these <u>plates</u>[^b], which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in <u>ignorance</u>[^c], even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.
