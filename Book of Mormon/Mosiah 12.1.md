# Mosiah 12:1

> And it came to pass that after the space of two years that Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and began to <u>prophesy</u>[^a] among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me, sayingâ€”Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will <u>visit</u>[^b] them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.
