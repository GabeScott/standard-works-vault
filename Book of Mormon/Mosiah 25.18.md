# Mosiah 25:18

> Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did <u>baptize</u>[^a] them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the <u>waters of Mormon</u>[^b]; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.
