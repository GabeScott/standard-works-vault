# Mormon 8:24

> And he knoweth their <u>prayers</u>[^a], that they were in behalf of their brethren. And he knoweth their faith, for in his name could they remove <u>mountains</u>[^b]; and in his name could they cause the earth to shake; and by the power of his word did they cause <u>prisons</u>[^c] to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery furnace could not harm them, neither wild beasts nor poisonous serpents, because of the power of his word.
