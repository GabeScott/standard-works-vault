# Alma 24:11

> And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to <u>take</u>[^a] them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stainâ€”
