# 2 Nephi 26:30

> Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have <u>charity</u>[^a], which <u>charity</u>[^b] is <u>love</u>[^c] . And except they should have charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
