# Alma 19:13

> For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have <u>seen</u>[^a] my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be <u>born</u>[^b] of a <u>woman</u>[^c], and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.
