# Moroni 8:22

> For behold that all little children are <u>alive</u>[^a] in Christ, and also all they that are without the <u>law</u>[^b] . For the power of <u>redemption</u>[^c] cometh on all them that have <u>no law</u>[^d]; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothingâ€”
