# 2 Nephi 10:2

> For behold, the <u>promises</u>[^a] which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of <u>unbelief</u>[^b], nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be <u>restored</u>[^c], that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.
