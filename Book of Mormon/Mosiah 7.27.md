# Mosiah 7:27

> And because he said unto them that Christ was the <u>God</u>[^a], the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the <u>image</u>[^b] of man, and it should be the <u>image</u>[^c] after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of <u>God</u>[^d], and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earthâ€”
