# 3 Nephi 1:22

> And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be <u>lyings</u>[^a] sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those <u>signs</u>[^b] and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the <u>more</u>[^c] part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.
