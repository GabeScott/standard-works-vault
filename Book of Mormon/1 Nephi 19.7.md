# 1 Nephi 19:7

> For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and soul, others set at <u>naught</u>[^a] and trample under their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men <u>trample</u>[^b] under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would speak in other wordsâ€”they set him at naught, and <u>hearken not</u>[^c] to the voice of his counsels.
