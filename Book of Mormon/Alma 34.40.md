# Alma 34:40

> And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have <u>patience</u>[^a], and that ye bear with all manner of <u>afflictions</u>[^b]; that ye do not <u>revile</u>[^c] against those who do cast you out because of your <u>exceeding</u>[^d] poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;
