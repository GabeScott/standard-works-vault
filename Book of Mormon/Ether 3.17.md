# Ether 3:17

> And now, as I, Moroni, said I could <u>not</u>[^a] make a full account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he <u>showed</u>[^b] himself unto the Nephites.
