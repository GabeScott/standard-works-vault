# Alma 51:5

> And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called <u>king-men</u>[^a], for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a <u>king</u>[^b] over the land.
