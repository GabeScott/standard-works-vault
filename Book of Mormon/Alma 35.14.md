# Alma 35:14

> And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the <u>two</u>[^a] sons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of bringing <u>many</u>[^b] of the <u>Zoramites</u>[^c] to repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands.
