# Alma 32:16

> Therefore, blessed are they who <u>humble</u>[^a] themselves without being <u>compelled</u>[^b] to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without <u>stubbornness</u>[^c] of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.
