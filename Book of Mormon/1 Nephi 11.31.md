# 1 Nephi 11:31

> And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were <u>sick</u>[^a], and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with <u>devils</u>[^b] and <u>unclean spirits</u>[^c]; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were <u>healed</u>[^d] by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
