# Mosiah 11:20

> And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was <u>Abinadi</u>[^a]; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lordâ€”Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will <u>visit</u>[^b] them in mine anger.
