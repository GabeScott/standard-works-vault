# Helaman 12:6

> Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath <u>created</u>[^a] them, should <u>rule</u>[^b] and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at <u>naught</u>[^c] his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.
