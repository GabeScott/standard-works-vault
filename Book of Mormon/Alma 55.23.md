# Alma 55:23

> And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief <u>captains</u>[^a] demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and <u>cast</u>[^b] them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.
