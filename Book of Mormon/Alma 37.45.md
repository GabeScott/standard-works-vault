# Alma 37:45

> And now I say, is there not a <u>type</u>[^a] in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.
