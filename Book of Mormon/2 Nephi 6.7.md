# 2 Nephi 6:7

> And <u>kings</u>[^a] shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that <u>I am</u>[^b] the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that <u>wait</u>[^c] for me.
