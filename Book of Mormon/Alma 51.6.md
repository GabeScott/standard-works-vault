# Alma 51:6

> And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of <u>freemen</u>[^a]; and thus was the <u>division</u>[^b] among them, for the freemen had sworn or <u>covenanted</u>[^c] to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.
