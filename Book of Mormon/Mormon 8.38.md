# Mormon 8:38

> O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye <u>ashamed</u>[^a] to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that <u>misery</u>[^b] which never diesâ€”because of the <u>praise</u>[^c] of the world?
