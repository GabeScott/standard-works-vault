# Mosiah 12:8

> And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will utterly <u>destroy</u>[^a] them from off the face of the earth; yet they shall leave a <u>record</u>[^b] behind them, and I will preserve them for other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other nations. And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this people.
