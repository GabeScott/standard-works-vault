# 1 Nephi 7:19

> And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the <u>daughters</u>[^a] of Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my life.
