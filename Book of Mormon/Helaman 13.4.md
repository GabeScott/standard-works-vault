# Helaman 13:4

> And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the <u>wall</u>[^a] thereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and <u>prophesied</u>[^b] unto the people whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.
