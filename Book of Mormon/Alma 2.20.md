# Alma 2:20

> And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the <u>valley of Gideon</u>[^a], the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of <u>Nehor</u>[^b] with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.
