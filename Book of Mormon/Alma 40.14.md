# Alma 40:14

> Now this is the state of the <u>souls</u>[^a] of the <u>wicked</u>[^b], yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, <u>fearful</u>[^c] looking for the fiery <u>indignation</u>[^d] of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this <u>state</u>[^e], as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.
