# Alma 39:9

> Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the <u>lusts</u>[^a] of your eyes, but <u>cross</u>[^b] yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and <u>cross</u>[^c] yourself in these things.
