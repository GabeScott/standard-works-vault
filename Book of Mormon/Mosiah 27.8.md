# Mosiah 27:8

> Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the <u>unbelievers</u>[^a]; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an <u>idolatrous</u>[^b] man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much <u>flattery</u>[^c] to the people; therefore he <u>led</u>[^d] many of the people to do after the manner of his <u>iniquities</u>[^e] .
