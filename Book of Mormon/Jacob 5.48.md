# Jacob 5:48

> And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is it not the <u>loftiness</u>[^a] of thy vineyard—have not the branches thereof overcome the roots which are good? And because the branches have overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster than the strength of the roots, <u>taking</u>[^b] strength unto themselves. Behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard have become corrupted?
