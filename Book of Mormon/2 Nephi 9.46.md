# 2 Nephi 9:46

> Prepare your souls for that glorious day when <u>justice</u>[^a] shall be administered unto the righteous, even the day of <u>judgment</u>[^b], that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful <u>guilt</u>[^c] in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God <u>Almighty</u>[^d] â€”but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath <u>obtained</u>[^e] me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.
