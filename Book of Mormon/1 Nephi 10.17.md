# 1 Nephi 10:17

> And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the <u>words</u>[^a] of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a <u>vision</u>[^b], and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of God—and the Son of God was the <u>Messiah</u>[^c] who should come—I, Nephi, was <u>desirous</u>[^d] also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, by the power of the <u>Holy Ghost</u>[^e], which is the <u>gift</u>[^f] of God unto <u>all</u>[^g] those who diligently seek him, as well in times of <u>old</u>[^h] as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men.
