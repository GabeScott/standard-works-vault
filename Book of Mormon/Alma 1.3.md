# Alma 1:3

> And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he <u>termed</u>[^a] to be the word of God, bearing down <u>against</u>[^b] the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become <u>popular</u>[^c]; and they ought <u>not</u>[^d] to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.
