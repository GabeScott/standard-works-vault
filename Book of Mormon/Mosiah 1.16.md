# Mosiah 1:16

> And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the <u>plates of brass</u>[^a]; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the <u>sword</u>[^b] of Laban, and the <u>ball</u>[^c] or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.
