# Alma 30:53

> But behold, the devil hath <u>deceived</u>[^a] me; for he <u>appeared</u>[^b] unto me in the <u>form</u>[^c] of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is <u>no</u>[^d] God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the <u>carnal</u>[^e] mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great <u>curse</u>[^f] upon me.
