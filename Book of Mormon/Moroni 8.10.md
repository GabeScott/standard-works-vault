# Moroni 8:10

> Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teachâ€”repentance and baptism unto those who are <u>accountable</u>[^a] and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little <u>children</u>[^b], and they shall all be saved with their little children.
