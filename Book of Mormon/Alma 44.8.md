# Alma 44:8

> And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his <u>sword</u>[^a] and his cimeter, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an <u>oath</u>[^b] unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.
