# 1 Nephi 1:8

> And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a <u>vision</u>[^a], even that he saw the <u>heavens</u>[^b] open, and he thought he <u>saw</u>[^c] God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.
