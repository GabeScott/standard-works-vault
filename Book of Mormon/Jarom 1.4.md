# Jarom 1:4

> And there are many among us who have many <u>revelations</u>[^a], for they are not all <u>stiffnecked</u>[^b] . And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have <u>communion</u>[^c] with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.
