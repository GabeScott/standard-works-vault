# 3 Nephi 12:1

> <u>And</u>[^a] it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of them who had been called, and received power and authority to <u>baptize</u>[^b], was <u>twelve</u>[^c] ) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and cried unto them, saying: <u>Blessed</u>[^d] are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have <u>chosen</u>[^e] from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power that they may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye have seen me and know that I am.
