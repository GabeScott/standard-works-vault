# Alma 29:8

> For behold, the Lord doth <u>grant</u>[^a] unto <u>all</u>[^b] nations, of their own nation and <u>tongue</u>[^c], to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he <u>seeth</u>[^d] fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.
