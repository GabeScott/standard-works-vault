# Helaman 4:4

> But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were <u>dissenters</u>[^a] who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in <u>stirring</u>[^b] them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.
