# Alma 21:5

> Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their <u>synagogues</u>[^a] to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an <u>angel</u>[^b] ? Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold <u>are</u>[^c] not this people as good as thy people?
