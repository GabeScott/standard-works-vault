# 1 Nephi 17:13

> And I will also be your <u>light</u>[^a] in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the <u>promised land</u>[^b]; and ye shall <u>know</u>[^c] that it is by me that ye are led.
