# Jacob 4:4

> For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we <u>knew</u>[^a] of Christ, and we had a hope of his <u>glory</u>[^b] many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy <u>prophets</u>[^c] which were before us.
