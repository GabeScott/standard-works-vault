# 2 Nephi 6:14

> And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the <u>second</u>[^a] time to recover them; wherefore, he will <u>manifest</u>[^b] himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the <u>destruction</u>[^c] of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe in him.
