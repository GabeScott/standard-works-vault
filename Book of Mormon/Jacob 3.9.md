# Jacob 3:9

> Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye <u>revile</u>[^a] no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.
