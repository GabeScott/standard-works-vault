# Mosiah 20:11

> And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites. But they <u>fought</u>[^a] for their lives, and for their <u>wives</u>[^b], and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.
