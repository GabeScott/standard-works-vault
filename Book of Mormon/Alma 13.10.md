# Alma 13:10

> Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this <u>high priesthood</u>[^a], there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding <u>faith</u>[^b] and <u>repentance</u>[^c], and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;
