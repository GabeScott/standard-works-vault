# 1 Nephi 11:25

> And it came to pass that I beheld that the <u>rod of iron</u>[^a], which my father had seen, was the <u>word</u>[^b] of God, which <u>led</u>[^c] to the fountain of <u>living waters</u>[^d], or to the <u>tree of life</u>[^e]; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
