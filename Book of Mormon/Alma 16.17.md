# Alma 16:17

> That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a <u>branch</u>[^a] be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the <u>rest</u>[^b] of the Lord their God.
