# Alma 26:36

> Now if this is <u>boasting</u>[^a], even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a <u>branch</u>[^b] of the tree of Israel, and has been <u>lost</u>[^c] from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, <u>wanderers</u>[^d] in a strange land.
