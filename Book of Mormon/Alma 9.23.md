# Alma 9:23

> And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress <u>contrary</u>[^a] to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more <u>tolerable</u>[^b] for the Lamanites than for them.
