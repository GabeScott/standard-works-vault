# Mosiah 16:3

> For they are <u>carnal</u>[^a] and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did <u>beguile</u>[^b] our first parents, which was the <u>cause</u>[^c] of their fall; which was the cause of <u>all</u>[^d] mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, <u>knowing</u>[^e] evil from good, <u>subjecting</u>[^f] themselves to the devil.
