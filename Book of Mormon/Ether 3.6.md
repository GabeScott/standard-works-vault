# Ether 3:6

> And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the <u>Lord</u>[^a] stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his <u>finger</u>[^b] . And the <u>veil</u>[^c] was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared <u>fell down</u>[^d] before the Lord, for he was struck with <u>fear</u>[^e] .
