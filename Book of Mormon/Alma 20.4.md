# Alma 20:4

> Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the <u>strength</u>[^a] of the Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of <u>prison</u>[^b] . Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?
