# Alma 7:6

> But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship <u>idols</u>[^a], but that ye do worship the true and the <u>living God</u>[^b], and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.
