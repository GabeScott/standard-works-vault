# Alma 15:1

> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of <u>Ammonihah</u>[^a], who had been <u>cast out</u>[^b] and stoned, because they believed in the words of Alma.
