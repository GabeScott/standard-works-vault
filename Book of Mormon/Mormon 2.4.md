# Mormon 2:4

> And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola, and we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend ourselves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did <u>fortify</u>[^a] the city with our might; but notwithstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive us out of the city.
