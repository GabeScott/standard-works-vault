# Alma 44:7

> And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and <u>inflict</u>[^a] the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.
