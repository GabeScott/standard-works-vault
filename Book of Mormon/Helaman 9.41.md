# Helaman 9:41

> And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god he could not <u>know</u>[^a] of all things. For behold, he has told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and even he has brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our chief judge.
