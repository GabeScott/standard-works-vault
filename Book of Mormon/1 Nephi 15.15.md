# 1 Nephi 15:15

> And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God, their <u>rock</u>[^a] and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment from the true <u>vine</u>[^b] ? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God?
