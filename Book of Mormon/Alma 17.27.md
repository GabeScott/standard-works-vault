# Alma 17:27

> Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and <u>scattered</u>[^a] the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.
