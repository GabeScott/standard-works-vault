# Alma 17:9

> And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and <u>prayed</u>[^a] much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an <u>instrument</u>[^b] in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the <u>traditions</u>[^c] of their fathers, which were not correct.
