# Alma 39:6

> For behold, if ye <u>deny</u>[^a] the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is <u>unpardonable</u>[^b]; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain <u>forgiveness</u>[^c]; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.
