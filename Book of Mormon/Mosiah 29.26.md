# Mosiah 29:26

> Now it is not common that the <u>voice</u>[^a] of the people desireth anything <u>contrary</u>[^b] to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the <u>people</u>[^c] to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the voice of the people.
