# 2 Nephi 33:3

> But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great <u>worth</u>[^a], and especially unto my people. For I <u>pray</u>[^b] continually for them by day, and mine <u>eyes</u>[^c] water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.
