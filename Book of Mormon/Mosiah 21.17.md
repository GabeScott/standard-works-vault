# Mosiah 21:17

> Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should <u>impart</u>[^a] to the support of the <u>widows</u>[^b] and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.
