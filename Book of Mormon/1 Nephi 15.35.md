# 1 Nephi 15:35

> And there is a place prepared, yea, even that <u>awful</u>[^a] <u>hell</u>[^b] of which I have spoken, and the <u>devil</u>[^c] is the preparator of it; wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that <u>justice</u>[^d] of which I have spoken.
