# Alma 5:38

> Behold, I say unto you, that the good <u>shepherd</u>[^a] doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not <u>hearken</u>[^b] unto the voice of the <u>good shepherd</u>[^c], to the <u>name</u>[^d] by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.
