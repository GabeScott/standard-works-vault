# Ether 13:21

> Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household save it were himself. And he should only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning <u>another</u>[^a] people receiving the land for their inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should be destroyed save it were <u>Coriantumr</u>[^b] .
