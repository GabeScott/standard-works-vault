# Alma 36:11

> And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did <u>not hear</u>[^a] them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God—I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.
