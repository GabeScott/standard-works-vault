# 2 Nephi 28:30

> For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, <u>precept</u>[^a] upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn <u>wisdom</u>[^b]; for unto him that <u>receiveth</u>[^c] I will give <u>more</u>[^d]; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.
