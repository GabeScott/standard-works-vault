# Moroni 9:6

> And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor <u>diligently</u>[^a]; for if we should cease to <u>labor</u>[^b], we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.
