# Mosiah 12:29

> And again he said unto them: If ye teach the <u>law</u>[^a] of Moses why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts upon <u>riches</u>[^b] ? Why do ye commit whoredoms and <u>spend</u>[^c] your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to send me to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil against this people?
