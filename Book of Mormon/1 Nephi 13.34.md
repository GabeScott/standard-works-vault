# 1 Nephi 13:34

> And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have <u>visited</u>[^a] the <u>remnant</u>[^b] of the house of Israel—and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father—wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do <u>stumble</u>[^c] exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the <u>gospel</u>[^d] of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I will be merciful unto the <u>Gentiles</u>[^e] in that day, insomuch that I will <u>bring forth</u>[^f] unto them, in mine own power, much of my <u>gospel</u>[^g], which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb.
