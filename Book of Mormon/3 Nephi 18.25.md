# 3 Nephi 18:25

> And ye see that I have commanded that <u>none</u>[^a] of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might <u>feel</u>[^b] and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.
