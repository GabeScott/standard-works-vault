# 2 Nephi 6:5

> And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be <u>likened</u>[^a] unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.
