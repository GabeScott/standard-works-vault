# 2 Nephi 1:25

> And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye have <u>accused</u>[^a] him that he sought power and <u>authority</u>[^b] over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare.
