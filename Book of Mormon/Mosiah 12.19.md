# Mosiah 12:19

> And they began to question him, that they might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to <u>accuse</u>[^a] him; but he answered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to their astonishment; for he did <u>withstand</u>[^b] them in all their questions, and did confound them in all their words.
