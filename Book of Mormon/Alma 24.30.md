# Alma 24:30

> And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once <u>enlightened</u>[^a] by the <u>Spirit</u>[^b] of God, and have had great <u>knowledge</u>[^c] of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have <u>fallen</u>[^d] away into sin and transgression, they become more <u>hardened</u>[^e], and thus their state becomes <u>worse</u>[^f] than though they had never known these things.
