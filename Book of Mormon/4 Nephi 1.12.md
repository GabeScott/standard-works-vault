# 4 Nephi 1:12

> And they did not walk any more after the <u>performances</u>[^a] and <u>ordinances</u>[^b] of the <u>law</u>[^c] of Moses; but they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in <u>fasting</u>[^d] and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.
