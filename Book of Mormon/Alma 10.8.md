# Alma 10:8

> And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the <u>man</u>[^a] whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy houseâ€”and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.
