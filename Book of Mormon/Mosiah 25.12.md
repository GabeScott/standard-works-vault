# Mosiah 25:12

> And it came to pass that those who <u>were</u>[^a] the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the <u>daughters</u>[^b] of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were <u>called</u>[^c] Nephites.
