# Mormon 5:6

> And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so <u>great</u>[^a] were their numbers that they did tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.
