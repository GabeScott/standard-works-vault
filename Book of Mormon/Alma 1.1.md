# Alma 1:1

> Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having <u>gone</u>[^a] the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established <u>laws</u>[^b], and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the <u>laws</u>[^c] which he had made.
