# Alma 18:16

> And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of God, therefore he perceived the <u>thoughts</u>[^b] of the king. And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew <u>seven</u>[^c] of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?
