# Mosiah 4:14

> And ye will not suffer your <u>children</u>[^a] that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye <u>suffer</u>[^b] that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and <u>quarrel</u>[^c] one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the <u>evil spirit</u>[^d] which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.
