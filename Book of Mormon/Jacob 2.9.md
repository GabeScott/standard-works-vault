# Jacob 2:9

> Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained, because of the strict commandment which I have received from God, to <u>admonish</u>[^a] you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded, instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.
