# Helaman 15:12

> Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the <u>promises</u>[^a] of the Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and notwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be <u>driven</u>[^b] to and fro upon the face of the earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for <u>refuge</u>[^c], the Lord shall be <u>merciful</u>[^d] unto them.
