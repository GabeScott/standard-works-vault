# 2 Nephi 24:2

> And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return to their <u>lands of promise</u>[^a] . And the house of Israel shall <u>possess</u>[^b] them, and the land of the Lord shall be for <u>servants</u>[^c] and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall <u>rule</u>[^d] over their oppressors.
