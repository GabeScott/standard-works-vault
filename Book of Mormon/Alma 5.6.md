# Alma 5:6

> And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in <u>remembrance</u>[^a] the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has <u>delivered</u>[^b] their souls from hell?
