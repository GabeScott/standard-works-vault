> Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their <u>wives</u>[^a] and their children should be <u>massacred</u>[^b] by the barbarous <u>cruelty</u>[^c] of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had <u>dissented</u>[^d] from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.
