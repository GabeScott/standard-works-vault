# Alma 40:5

> Now, whether there shall be one time, or a <u>second</u>[^a] time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God <u>knoweth</u>[^b] all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the caseâ€”that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.
