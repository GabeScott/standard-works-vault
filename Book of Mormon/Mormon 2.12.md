# Mormon 2:12

> And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their <u>mourning</u>[^a] and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that they would <u>again</u>[^b] become a righteous people.
