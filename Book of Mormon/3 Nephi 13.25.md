# 3 Nephi 13:25

> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he looked upon the <u>twelve</u>[^a] whom he had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they whom I have chosen to <u>minister</u>[^b] unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, <u>take</u>[^c] no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than <u>raiment</u>[^d] ?
