# Alma 37:46

> O my son, do not let us be <u>slothful</u>[^a] because of the <u>easiness</u>[^b] of the <u>way</u>[^c]; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would <u>look</u>[^d] they might <u>live</u>[^e]; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.
