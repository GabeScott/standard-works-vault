# Alma 26:37

> Now my brethren, we see that God is <u>mindful</u>[^a] of every <u>people</u>[^b], whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.
