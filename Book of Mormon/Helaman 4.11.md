# Helaman 4:11

> Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, <u>would not</u>[^a] have happened had it not been for their <u>wickedness</u>[^b] and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.
