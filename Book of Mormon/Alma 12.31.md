> Wherefore, he gave <u>commandments</u>[^a] unto men, they having first transgressed the <u>first</u>[^b] commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as gods, <u>knowing</u>[^c] good from evil, placing themselves in a state to <u>act</u>[^d], or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do goodâ€”
