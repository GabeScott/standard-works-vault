# Jacob 5:47

> But <u>what</u>[^a] could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have <u>stretched</u>[^b] forth mine <u>hand</u>[^c] almost all the day long, and the <u>end</u>[^d] draweth nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that they should be burned. Who is it that has corrupted my vineyard?
