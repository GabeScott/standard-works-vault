# 2 Nephi 27:15

> But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying: <u>Read</u>[^a] this, I pray thee. And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read them.
