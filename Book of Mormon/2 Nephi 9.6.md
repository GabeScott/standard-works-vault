# 2 Nephi 9:6

> For as <u>death</u>[^a] hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful <u>plan</u>[^b] of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of <u>resurrection</u>[^c], and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the <u>fall</u>[^d]; and the fall came by reason of <u>transgression</u>[^e]; and because man became fallen they were <u>cut off</u>[^f] from the <u>presence</u>[^g] of the Lord.
