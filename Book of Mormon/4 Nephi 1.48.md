# 4 Nephi 1:48

> And it came to pass that when three hundred and twenty years had passed away, <u>Ammaron</u>[^a], being constrained by the Holy Ghost, did <u>hide</u>[^b] up the <u>records</u>[^c] which were <u>sacred</u>[^d] —yea, even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred—even until the three hundred and twentieth year from the coming of Christ.
