# 3 Nephi 15:1

> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I <u>taught</u>[^a] before I ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and <u>doeth</u>[^b] them, him will I <u>raise up</u>[^c] at the last day.
