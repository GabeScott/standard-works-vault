# Alma 41:11

> And now, my son, all men that are in a state of <u>nature</u>[^a], or I would say, in a <u>carnal</u>[^b] state, are in the <u>gall of bitterness</u>[^c] and in the <u>bonds</u>[^d] of iniquity; they are <u>without</u>[^e] God in the world, and they have gone <u>contrary</u>[^f] to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.
