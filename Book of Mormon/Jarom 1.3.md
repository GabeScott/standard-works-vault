# Jarom 1:3

> Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the <u>stiffness</u>[^a] of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet <u>swept</u>[^b] them off from the face of the land.
