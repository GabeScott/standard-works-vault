# Alma 29:4

> I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their <u>desire</u>[^a], whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their <u>wills</u>[^b], whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.
