# Helaman 8:18

> Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were <u>many</u>[^a] before the days of Abraham who were called by the <u>order</u>[^b] of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.
