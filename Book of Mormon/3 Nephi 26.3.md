> And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the <u>time</u>[^a] that he should come in his <u>glory</u>[^b] â€”yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the <u>elements</u>[^c] should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be <u>wrapt</u>[^d] together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away;
