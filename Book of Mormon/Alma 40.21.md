# Alma 40:21

> But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a <u>space</u>[^a] between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in <u>happiness</u>[^b] or in <u>misery</u>[^c] until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be <u>brought</u>[^d] to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.
