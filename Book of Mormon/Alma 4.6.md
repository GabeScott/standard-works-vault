# Alma 4:6

> And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding <u>riches</u>[^a], and their <u>fine</u>[^b] silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their <u>industry</u>[^c]; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly <u>apparel</u>[^d] .
