# Alma 10:13

> Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning <u>devices</u>[^a] they might catch them in their words, that they might <u>find</u>[^b] witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.
