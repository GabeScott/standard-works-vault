# Alma 26:12

> Yea, I know that I am <u>nothing</u>[^a]; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will <u>not</u>[^b] boast of myself, but I will <u>boast</u>[^c] of my God, for in his <u>strength</u>[^d] I can do all <u>things</u>[^e]; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.
