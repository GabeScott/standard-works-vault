# 3 Nephi 23:9

> Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant <u>Samuel</u>[^a], the Lamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should glorify his name in me that there were <u>many</u>[^b] <u>saints</u>[^c] who should <u>arise</u>[^d] from the dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he said unto them: Was it not so?
