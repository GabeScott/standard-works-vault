# Omni 1:22

> It also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his first parents came out from the <u>tower</u>[^a], at the time the Lord <u>confounded</u>[^b] the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just; and their <u>bones</u>[^c] lay scattered in the land northward.
