# Alma 46:21

> And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running <u>together</u>[^a] with their armor girded about their loins, <u>rending</u>[^b] their garments in token, or as a <u>covenant</u>[^c], that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be <u>ashamed</u>[^d] to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.
