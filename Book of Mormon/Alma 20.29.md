# Alma 20:29

> And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had <u>suffered</u>[^a] hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were <u>patient</u>[^b] in all their sufferings.
