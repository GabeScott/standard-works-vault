# Alma 14:26

> And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great <u>afflictions</u>[^a], O Lord? O Lord, <u>give</u>[^b] us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto <u>deliverance</u>[^c] . And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.
