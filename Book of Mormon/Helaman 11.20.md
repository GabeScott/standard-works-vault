# Helaman 11:20

> And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did <u>cover</u>[^a] the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west to the sea east.
