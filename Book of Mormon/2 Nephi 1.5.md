# 2 Nephi 1:5

> But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a <u>land of promise</u>[^a], a land which is <u>choice</u>[^b] above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath <u>covenanted</u>[^c] with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath <u>covenanted</u>[^d] this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be <u>led</u>[^e] out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.
