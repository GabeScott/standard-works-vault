# 1 Nephi 19:1

> And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the <u>record</u>[^a] of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did <u>engraven</u>[^b] the record of my <u>father</u>[^c], and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.
