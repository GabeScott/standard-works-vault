# Alma 7:9

> But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying— <u>Repent</u>[^a] ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God <u>cometh</u>[^b] upon the face of the earth.
