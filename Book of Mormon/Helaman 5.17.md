# Helaman 5:17

> And it came to pass that they did <u>preach</u>[^a] with great <u>power</u>[^b], insomuch that they did confound many of those <u>dissenters</u>[^c] who had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.
