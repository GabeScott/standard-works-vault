# 1 Nephi 22:23

> For the time speedily shall come that all <u>churches</u>[^a] which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up to become <u>popular</u>[^b] in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the <u>devil</u>[^c] are they who need fear, and tremble, and <u>quake</u>[^d]; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be <u>consumed</u>[^e] as stubble; and this is according to the words of the prophet.
