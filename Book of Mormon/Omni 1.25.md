# Omni 1:25

> And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king <u>Benjamin</u>[^a] to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall <u>deliver</u>[^b] up <u>these plates</u>[^c] unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are <u>good</u>[^d]; for there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord: and that which is evil cometh from the devil.
