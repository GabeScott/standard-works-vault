# Words of Mormon 1:3

> And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an <u>abridgment</u>[^a] from the <u>plates of Nephi</u>[^b], down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the <u>records</u>[^c] which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king <u>Benjamin</u>[^d], and also many of the words of Nephi.
