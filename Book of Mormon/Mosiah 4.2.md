# Mosiah 4:2

> And they had <u>viewed</u>[^a] themselves in their own <u>carnal</u>[^b] state, even <u>less</u>[^c] than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the <u>atoning</u>[^d] blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be <u>purified</u>[^e]; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who <u>created</u>[^f] heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.
