# 2 Nephi 26:5

> And they that kill the <u>prophets</u>[^a], and the saints, the depths of the earth shall <u>swallow</u>[^b] them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and <u>mountains</u>[^c] shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.
