# Alma 37:21

> And now, I will speak unto you concerning those <u>twenty-four</u>[^a] plates, that ye keep them, that the <u>mysteries</u>[^b] and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made <u>manifest</u>[^c] unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these <u>interpreters</u>[^d] .
