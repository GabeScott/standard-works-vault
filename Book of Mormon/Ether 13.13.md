# Ether 13:13

> And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he <u>hid</u>[^a] himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people.
