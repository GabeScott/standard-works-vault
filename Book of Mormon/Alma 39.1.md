# Alma 39:1

> And now, my <u>son</u>[^a], I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set a good <u>example</u>[^b] for thee?
