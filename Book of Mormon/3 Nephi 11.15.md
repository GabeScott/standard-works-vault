# 3 Nephi 11:15

> And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and <u>did</u>[^a] feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and did bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that should come.
