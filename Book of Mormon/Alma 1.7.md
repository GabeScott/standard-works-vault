# Alma 1:7

> And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their <u>teachers</u>[^a]; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the <u>words</u>[^b] of God.
