# 2 Nephi 25:1

> Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were <u>hard</u>[^a] for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.
