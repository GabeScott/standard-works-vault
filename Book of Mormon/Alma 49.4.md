# Alma 49:4

> But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a <u>ridge</u>[^a] of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of <u>entrance</u>[^b] .
