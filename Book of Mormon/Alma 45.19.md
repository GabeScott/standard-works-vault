# Alma 45:19

> Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the <u>Spirit</u>[^a], or <u>buried</u>[^b] by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his death and burial.
