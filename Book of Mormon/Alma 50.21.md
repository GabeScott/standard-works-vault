# Alma 50:21

> And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which <u>brought upon</u>[^a] them their wars and their destructions.
