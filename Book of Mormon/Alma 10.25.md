# Alma 10:25

> But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to <u>blind</u>[^a] your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?
