# Helaman 1:13

> And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the <u>voice</u>[^a] of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.
