# Alma 32:5

> And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, <u>what</u>[^a] shall these my brethren do, for they are <u>despised</u>[^b] of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have <u>cast</u>[^c] us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have <u>no</u>[^d] place to worship our God; and behold, <u>what</u>[^e] shall we do?
