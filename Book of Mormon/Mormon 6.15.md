# Mormon 6:15

> And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by the sword, with their ten thousand each; yea, even <u>all</u>[^a] my people, save it were those twenty and four who were with me, and also a <u>few</u>[^b] who had escaped into the south countries, and a few who had deserted over unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth, being left by the hands of those who slew them to molder upon the land, and to crumble and to return to their mother earth.
