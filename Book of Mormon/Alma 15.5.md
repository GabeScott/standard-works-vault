# Alma 15:5

> And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was <u>exceedingly</u>[^a] sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.
