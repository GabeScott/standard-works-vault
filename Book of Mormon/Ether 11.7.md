# Ether 11:7

> And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of their wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and <u>contentions</u>[^a] in all the land, and also many famines and pestilences, insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all this came to pass in the days of Shiblom.
