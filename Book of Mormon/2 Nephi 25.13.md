# 2 Nephi 25:13

> Behold, they will <u>crucify</u>[^a] him; and after he is laid in a <u>sepulchre</u>[^b] for the space of <u>three</u>[^c] days he shall <u>rise</u>[^d] from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have <u>seen</u>[^e] his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.
