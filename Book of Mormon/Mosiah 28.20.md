# Mosiah 28:20

> And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of <u>brass</u>[^a], and all the things which he had kept, and <u>conferred</u>[^b] them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the <u>interpreters</u>[^c], and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and <u>preserve</u>[^d] them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.
