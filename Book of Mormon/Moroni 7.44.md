# Moroni 7:44

> If so, his <u>faith</u>[^a] and hope is vain, for none is <u>acceptable</u>[^b] before God, save the <u>meek</u>[^c] and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and <u>confesses</u>[^d] by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.
