# Alma 11:22

> And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I <u>give</u>[^b] thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.
