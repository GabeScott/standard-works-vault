# Mosiah 4:3

> And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a <u>remission</u>[^a] of their sins, and having peace of <u>conscience</u>[^b], because of the exceeding <u>faith</u>[^c] which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the <u>words</u>[^d] which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.
