# Omni 1:14

> And they discovered a <u>people</u>[^a], who were called the people of Zarahemla. Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the <u>plates of brass</u>[^b] which contained the record of the Jews.
