# 1 Nephi 13:12

> And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and <u>wrought</u>[^a] upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land.
