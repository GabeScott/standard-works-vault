# Alma 53:16

> But behold, it came to pass they had many <u>sons</u>[^a], who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.
