# Alma 46:10

> Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to <u>destroy</u>[^a] the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of <u>liberty</u>[^b] which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the <u>righteousâ€™</u>[^c] sake.
