# Alma 59:3

> And it came to pass that he immediately sent <u>an</u>[^a] epistle to <u>Pahoran</u>[^b], desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.
