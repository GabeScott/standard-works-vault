# Alma 5:5

> And behold, after that, they were brought into <u>bondage</u>[^a] by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of <u>bondage</u>[^b] by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.
