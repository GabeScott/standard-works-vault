# 3 Nephi 1:29

> And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were <u>led away</u>[^a] by some who were <u>Zoramites</u>[^b], by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.
