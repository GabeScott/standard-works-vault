# Mormon 5:14

> And behold, they shall go unto the <u>unbelieving</u>[^a] of the <u>Jews</u>[^b]; and for this intent shall they goâ€”that they may be <u>persuaded</u>[^c] that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may bring about, through his most Beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the house of Israel, to the <u>land</u>[^d] of their inheritance, which the Lord their God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his <u>covenant</u>[^e];
