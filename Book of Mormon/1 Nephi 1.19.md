# 1 Nephi 1:19

> And it came to pass that the <u>Jews</u>[^a] did <u>mock</u>[^b] him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their <u>wickedness</u>[^c] and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a <u>Messiah</u>[^d], and also the redemption of the world.
