# Mosiah 5:5

> And we are willing to enter into a <u>covenant</u>[^a] with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a <u>never-ending</u>[^b] torment, as has been spoken by the <u>angel</u>[^c], that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.
