# Alma 58:25

> And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief <u>captains</u>[^a] of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.
