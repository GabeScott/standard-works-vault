# Jacob 2:2

> Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the <u>responsibility</u>[^a] which I am under to God, to <u>magnify</u>[^b] mine office with <u>soberness</u>[^c], and that I might <u>rid</u>[^d] my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.
