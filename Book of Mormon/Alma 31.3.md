# Alma 31:3

> Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called <u>Antionum</u>[^a], which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of <u>Jershon</u>[^b], which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.
