# 2 Nephi 26:22

> And there are also secret <u>combinations</u>[^a], even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the <u>devil</u>[^b], for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and <u>works</u>[^c] of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.
