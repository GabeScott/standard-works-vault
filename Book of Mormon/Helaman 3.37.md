# Helaman 3:37

> And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, <u>Helaman</u>[^a] died, and his eldest son <u>Nephi</u>[^b] began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.
