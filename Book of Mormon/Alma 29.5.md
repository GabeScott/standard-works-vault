# Alma 29:5

> Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is <u>blameless</u>[^a]; but he that <u>knoweth</u>[^b] good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of <u>conscience</u>[^c] .
