# 2 Nephi 26:33

> For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he <u>inviteth</u>[^a] them <u>all</u>[^b] to <u>come</u>[^c] unto him and partake of his goodness; and he <u>denieth</u>[^d] none that come unto him, black and white, <u>bond</u>[^e] and free, male and female; and he remembereth the <u>heathen</u>[^f]; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
