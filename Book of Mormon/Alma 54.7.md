# Alma 54:7

> Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful <u>hell</u>[^a] that awaits to receive such <u>murderers</u>[^b] as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.
