# Alma 9:30

> And now, my <u>beloved</u>[^a] brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a <u>lost</u>[^b] and a fallen people.
