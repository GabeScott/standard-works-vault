# 2 Nephi 30:3

> And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall <u>believe</u>[^a] the words which are written; and <u>they</u>[^b] shall carry them forth unto the <u>remnant</u>[^c] of our seed.
