# Moroni 10:3

> Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how <u>merciful</u>[^a] the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and <u>ponder</u>[^b] it in your <u>hearts</u>[^c] .
