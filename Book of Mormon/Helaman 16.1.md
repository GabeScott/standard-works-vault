# Helaman 16:1

> And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the <u>walls</u>[^a] of the city. And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be <u>baptized</u>[^b] unto the Lord.
