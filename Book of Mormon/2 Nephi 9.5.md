# 2 Nephi 9:5

> Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great <u>Creator</u>[^a] that he <u>suffereth</u>[^b] himself to become <u>subject</u>[^c] unto man in the flesh, and <u>die</u>[^d] for <u>all</u>[^e] men, that all men might become subject unto him.
