# Alma 46:29

> And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites—and he also saw that his people were <u>doubtful</u>[^a] concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken—therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the <u>land of Nephi</u>[^b] .
