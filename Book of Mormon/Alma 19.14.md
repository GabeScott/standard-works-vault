# Alma 19:14

> Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to his <u>prayers</u>[^a] upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their iniquities and their <u>traditions</u>[^b], he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren; and he was also overpowered with <u>joy</u>[^c]; and thus they all three had <u>sunk</u>[^d] to the earth.
