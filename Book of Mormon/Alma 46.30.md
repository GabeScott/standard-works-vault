# Alma 46:30

> Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more <u>strength</u>[^a]; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.
