# 2 Nephi 3:11

> But a <u>seer</u>[^a] will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give <u>power</u>[^b] to <u>bring forth</u>[^c] my word unto the seed of thy loins—and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.
