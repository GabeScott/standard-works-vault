# 2 Nephi 3:11

> But a <u>seer</u>[^a] will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give <u>power</u>[^b] to <u>bring forth</u>[^c] my word unto the seed of thy loinsâ€”and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.
