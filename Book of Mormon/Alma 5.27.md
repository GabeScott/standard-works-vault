# Alma 5:27

> Have ye walked, keeping yourselves <u>blameless</u>[^a] before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently <u>humble</u>[^b] ? That your garments have been <u>cleansed</u>[^c] and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to <u>redeem</u>[^d] his people from their sins?
