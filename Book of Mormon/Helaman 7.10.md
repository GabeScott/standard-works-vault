# Helaman 7:10

> And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the <u>garden</u>[^a] of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.
