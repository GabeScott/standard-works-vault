# Jacob 5:46

> And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted, that they bring forth no good <u>fruit</u>[^a]; and these I had hoped to preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self. But, behold, they have become like unto the wild olive tree, and they are of no worth but to be <u>hewn</u>[^b] down and cast into the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.
