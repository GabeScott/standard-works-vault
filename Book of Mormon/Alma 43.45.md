# Alma 43:45

> Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a <u>better</u>[^a] cause, for they were not <u>fighting</u>[^b] for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their <u>liberties</u>[^c], their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.
