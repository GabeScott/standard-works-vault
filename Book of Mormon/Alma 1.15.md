# Alma 1:15

> And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was <u>Nehor</u>[^a]; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious <u>death</u>[^b] .
