# 3 Nephi 11:40

> And whoso shall <u>declare</u>[^a] more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a <u>sandy</u>[^b] foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.
