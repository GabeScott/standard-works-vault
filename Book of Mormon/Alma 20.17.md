# Alma 20:17

> But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were <u>better</u>[^a] that he should fall than thee, for behold, he has <u>repented</u>[^b] of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.
