> And he loveth those who will have him to be their God. Behold, he loved our <u>fathers</u>[^a], and he <u>covenanted</u>[^b] with them, yea, even Abraham, <u>Isaac</u>[^c], and <u>Jacob</u>[^d]; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of <u>Egypt</u>[^e] .
