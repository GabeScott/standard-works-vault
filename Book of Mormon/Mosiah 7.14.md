# Mosiah 7:14

> And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly <u>glad</u>[^a], and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are <u>yet</u>[^b] alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.
