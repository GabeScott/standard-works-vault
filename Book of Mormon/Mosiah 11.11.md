# Mosiah 11:11

> And the seats which were set apart for the <u>high priests</u>[^a], which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.
