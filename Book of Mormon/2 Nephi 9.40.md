# 2 Nephi 9:40

> O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will <u>revile</u>[^a] against the <u>truth</u>[^b]; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are <u>hard</u>[^c] against all <u>uncleanness</u>[^d]; but the <u>righteous</u>[^e] fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.
