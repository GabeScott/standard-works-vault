# Alma 42:22

> But there is a law given, and a <u>punishment</u>[^a] affixed, and a <u>repentance</u>[^b] granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the <u>law</u>[^c], and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.
