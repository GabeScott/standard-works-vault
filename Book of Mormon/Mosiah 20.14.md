# Mosiah 20:14

> But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him. And they brought him. And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people? Behold, my people have not broken the <u>oath</u>[^a] that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?
