# 3 Nephi 9:22

> Therefore, whoso <u>repenteth</u>[^a] and cometh unto me <u>as</u>[^b] a <u>little</u>[^c] child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have <u>laid down</u>[^d] my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.
