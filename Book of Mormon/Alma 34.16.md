# Alma 34:16

> And thus <u>mercy</u>[^a] can satisfy the demands of <u>justice</u>[^b], and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of <u>justice</u>[^c]; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal <u>plan</u>[^d] of <u>redemption</u>[^e] .
