# Alma 48:23

> Now, they were <u>sorry</u>[^a] to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not allâ€”they were <u>sorry</u>[^b] to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, <u>unprepared</u>[^c] to meet their God.
