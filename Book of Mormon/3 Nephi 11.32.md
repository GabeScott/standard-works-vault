> And this is my <u>doctrine</u>[^a], and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear <u>record</u>[^b] of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the <u>Holy Ghost</u>[^c] beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.
