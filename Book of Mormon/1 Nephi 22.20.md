# 1 Nephi 22:20

> And the Lord will surely <u>prepare</u>[^a] a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A <u>prophet</u>[^b] shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be <u>cut off</u>[^c] from among the people.
