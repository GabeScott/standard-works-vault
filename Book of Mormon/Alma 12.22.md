# Alma 12:22

> Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did <u>fall</u>[^a] by the partaking of the forbidden <u>fruit</u>[^b], according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a <u>lost</u>[^c] and fallen people.
