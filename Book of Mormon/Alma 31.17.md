# Alma 31:17

> But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast <u>elected</u>[^a] us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth <u>bind</u>[^b] them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.
