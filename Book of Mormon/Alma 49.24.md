# Alma 49:24

> There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their <u>shields</u>[^a], and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.
