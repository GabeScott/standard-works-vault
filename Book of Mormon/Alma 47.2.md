# Alma 47:2

> And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they <u>feared</u>[^a] to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.
