# 2 Nephi 8:13

> And <u>forgettest</u>[^a] the Lord thy maker, that hath <u>stretched</u>[^b] forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the <u>oppressor</u>[^c], as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?
