# 3 Nephi 6:14

> And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and <u>they</u>[^a] would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all <u>diligence</u>[^b] to keep the commandments of the Lord.
