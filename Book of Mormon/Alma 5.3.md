# Alma 5:3

> I, Alma, having been <u>consecrated</u>[^a] by my father, Alma, to be a <u>high priest</u>[^b] over the church of God, he having power and <u>authority</u>[^c] from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the <u>land</u>[^d] which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.
