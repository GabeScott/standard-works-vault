# Alma 44:5

> And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, <u>by</u>[^a] our faith, by our religion, and by our <u>rites</u>[^b] of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our <u>wives</u>[^c] and our children, by that <u>liberty</u>[^d] which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us—
