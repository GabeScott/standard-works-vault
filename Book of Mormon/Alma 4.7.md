# Alma 4:7

> Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be <u>teachers</u>[^a], and <u>priests</u>[^b], and <u>elders</u>[^c] over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.
