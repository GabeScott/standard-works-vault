# Alma 41:1

> And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have <u>wrested</u>[^a] the scriptures, and have gone far <u>astray</u>[^b] because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been <u>worried</u>[^c] also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.
