# 1 Nephi 14:10

> And he said unto me: Behold there are save <u>two</u>[^a] churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the <u>other</u>[^b] is the church of the <u>devil</u>[^c]; wherefore, <u>whoso</u>[^d] belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the <u>whore</u>[^e] of all the earth.
