# 1 Nephi 5:2

> For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had <u>complained</u>[^a] against my father, telling him that he was a <u>visionary</u>[^b] man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.
