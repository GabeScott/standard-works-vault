# Ether 2:13

> And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place <u>Moriancumer</u>[^a]; and they dwelt in <u>tents</u>[^b], and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years.
