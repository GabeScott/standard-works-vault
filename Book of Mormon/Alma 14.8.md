# Alma 14:8

> And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be <u>cast</u>[^a] into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be <u>burned</u>[^b] and destroyed by fire.
