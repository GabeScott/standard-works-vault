# 1 Nephi 12:18

> And the large and spacious <u>building</u>[^a], which thy father saw, is vain <u>imaginations</u>[^b] and the <u>pride</u>[^c] of the children of men. And a great and a terrible <u>gulf</u>[^d] divideth them; yea, even the word of the <u>justice</u>[^e] of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and forever.
