# Mormon 5:12

> Now <u>these things</u>[^a] are <u>written</u>[^b] unto the <u>remnant</u>[^c] of the house of Jacob; and they are written after this manner, because it is known of God that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be <u>hid</u>[^d] up unto the Lord that they may come forth in his own due time.
