# 3 Nephi 16:10

> And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you: At that day when the Gentiles shall <u>sin</u>[^a] against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, and shall be <u>lifted up</u>[^b] in the pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and <u>murders</u>[^c], and <u>priestcrafts</u>[^d], and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they shall do all those things, and shall <u>reject</u>[^e] the fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.
