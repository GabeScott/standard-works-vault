# Alma 14:2

> But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the <u>plainness</u>[^a] of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had <u>lied</u>[^b] unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.
