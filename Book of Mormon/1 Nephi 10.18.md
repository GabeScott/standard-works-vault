# 1 Nephi 10:18

> For he is the <u>same</u>[^a] yesterday, today, and forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him.

[1 Nephi 10:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p18#p18)
#### same yesterday, today, and forever
- How is this different from the children of men? 
	- We change, for better or for worse. We fail and we sin.
- I find this interesting because we also know that those that end up in a lower kingdom will also be the same forever. They will be stuck forever in their imperfection. Thus, we should never try to remain the same until we are perfect.
