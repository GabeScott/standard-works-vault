# Helaman 11:21

> And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the <u>church</u>[^a] did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.
