# 3 Nephi 8:23

> And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and <u>howling</u>[^a] and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.
