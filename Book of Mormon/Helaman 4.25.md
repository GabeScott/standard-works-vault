# Helaman 4:25

> Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of <u>unbelief</u>[^a] and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should <u>cleave</u>[^b] unto the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.
