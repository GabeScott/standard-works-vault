# Alma 7:1

> Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my <u>own</u>[^a] mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the <u>judgment-seat</u>[^b], having had much business that I could not come unto you.
