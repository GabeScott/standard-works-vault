# Moroni 8:16

> Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having <u>authority</u>[^a] from God; and I fear not what man can do; for <u>perfect</u>[^b] <u>love</u>[^c] <u>casteth out</u>[^d] all fear.
