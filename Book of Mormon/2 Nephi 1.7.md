# 2 Nephi 1:7

> Wherefore, this <u>land</u>[^a] is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of <u>liberty</u>[^b] unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound <u>cursed</u>[^c] shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.
