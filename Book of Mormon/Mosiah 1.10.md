# Mosiah 1:10

> Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this <u>people</u>[^a], or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a <u>king</u>[^b] and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.
