# 3 Nephi 3:25

> And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their <u>prayers</u>[^a] unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.
