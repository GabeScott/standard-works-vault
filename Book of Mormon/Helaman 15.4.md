# Helaman 15:4

> But behold my brethren, the <u>Lamanites</u>[^a] hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the <u>tradition</u>[^b] of their fathers. But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord <u>prolonged</u>[^c] their days.
