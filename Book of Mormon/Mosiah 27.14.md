# Mosiah 27:14

> And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath <u>heard</u>[^a] the prayers of his people, and also the <u>prayers</u>[^b] of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has <u>prayed</u>[^c] with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the <u>knowledge</u>[^d] of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to <u>convince</u>[^e] thee of the power and authority of God, that the <u>prayers</u>[^f] of his servants might be answered according to their faith.
