# 2 Nephi 1:10

> But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in <u>unbelief</u>[^a], after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord—having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true <u>Messiah</u>[^b], their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is <u>just</u>[^c] shall rest upon them.
