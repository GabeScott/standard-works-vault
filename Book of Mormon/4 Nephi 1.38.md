# 4 Nephi 1:38

> And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle in <u>unbelief</u>[^a], but they did <u>wilfully rebel</u>[^b] against the gospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning, did dwindle.
