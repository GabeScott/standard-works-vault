# Jacob 3:5

> Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not <u>forgotten</u>[^a] the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father—that they should have save it were <u>one</u>[^b] wife, and <u>concubines</u>[^c] they should have none, and there should not be <u>whoredoms</u>[^d] committed among them.
