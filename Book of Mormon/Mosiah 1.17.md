# Mosiah 1:17

> Therefore, as they were <u>unfaithful</u>[^a] they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were <u>driven</u>[^b] back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore <u>afflictions</u>[^c], to stir them up in <u>remembrance</u>[^d] of their duty.
