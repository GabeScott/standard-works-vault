# Mosiah 8:8

> And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of <u>many</u>[^a] days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with <u>bones</u>[^b] of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.
