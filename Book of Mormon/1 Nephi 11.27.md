# 1 Nephi 11:27

> And I looked and <u>beheld</u>[^a] the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the <u>prophet</u>[^b] who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was <u>baptized</u>[^c] of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a <u>dove</u>[^d] .
