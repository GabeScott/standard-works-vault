# Ether 4:1

> And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the <u>mount</u>[^a] from the presence of the Lord, and <u>write</u>[^b] the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men <u>until</u>[^c] after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people.
