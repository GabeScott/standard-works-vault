# Alma 44:15

> Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a <u>covenant</u>[^a] of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to <u>depart</u>[^b] into the wilderness.
