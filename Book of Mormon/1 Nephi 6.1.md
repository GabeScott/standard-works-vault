# 1 Nephi 6:1

> And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in <u>this</u>[^a] part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon these <u>plates</u>[^b] which I am <u>writing</u>[^c]; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my <u>father</u>[^d]; wherefore, I do not write it in this work.
