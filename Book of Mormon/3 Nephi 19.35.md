# 3 Nephi 19:35

> And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: <u>So</u>[^a] great <u>faith</u>[^b] have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great <u>miracles</u>[^c], because of their <u>unbelief</u>[^d] .
