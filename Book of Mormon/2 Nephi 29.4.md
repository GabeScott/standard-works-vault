# 2 Nephi 29:4

> But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a <u>Bible</u>[^a]; and it shall proceed forth from the <u>Jews</u>[^b], mine ancient covenant people. And what <u>thank</u>[^c] they the <u>Jews</u>[^d] for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?
