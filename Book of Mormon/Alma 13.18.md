# Alma 13:18

> But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the <u>holy order</u>[^a] of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.
