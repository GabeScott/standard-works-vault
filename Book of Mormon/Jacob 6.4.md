# Jacob 6:4

> And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of <u>Israel</u>[^a], both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his <u>hands</u>[^b] unto them all the day long; and they are a <u>stiffnecked</u>[^c] and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
