# 3 Nephi 30:2

> Turn, all ye <u>Gentiles</u>[^a], from your wicked ways; and <u>repent</u>[^b] of your evil doings, of your <u>lyings</u>[^c] and deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your <u>murders</u>[^d], and your <u>priestcrafts</u>[^e], and your <u>envyings</u>[^f], and your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye may be <u>numbered</u>[^g] with my people who are of the house of Israel.
