# Jacob 3:10

> Wherefore, ye shall remember your <u>children</u>[^a], how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the <u>example</u>[^b] that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.
