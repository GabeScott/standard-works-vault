# Alma 49:13

> For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built <u>forts</u>[^a] of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an <u>oath</u>[^b] that they would destroy the people of that city.
