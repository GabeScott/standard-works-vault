# 2 Nephi 4:34

> O Lord, I have <u>trusted</u>[^a] in thee, and I will <u>trust</u>[^b] in thee forever. I will not put my <u>trust</u>[^c] in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his <u>trust</u>[^d] in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.
