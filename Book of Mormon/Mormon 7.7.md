> And he hath brought to pass the <u>redemption</u>[^a] of the <u>world</u>[^b], whereby he that is found <u>guiltless</u>[^c] before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to <u>dwell</u>[^d] in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the <u>choirs</u>[^e] above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are <u>one God</u>[^f], in a state of <u>happiness</u>[^g] which hath no end.
