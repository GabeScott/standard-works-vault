# Alma 9:11

> Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his <u>long-suffering</u>[^a] towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of <u>endless</u>[^b] misery and woe.
