# Alma 4:15

> And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their <u>inequality</u>[^a], began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.
