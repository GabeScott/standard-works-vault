# Helaman 13:14

> But behold, it is for the righteousâ€™ sake that it is spared. But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be <u>ripe</u>[^a] for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in her.
