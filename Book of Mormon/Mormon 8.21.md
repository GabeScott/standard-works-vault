# Mormon 8:21

> And he that shall breathe out <u>wrath</u>[^a] and <u>strifes</u>[^b] against the work of the Lord, and against the <u>covenant</u>[^c] people of the Lord who are the house of Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work of the Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israelâ€”the same is in danger to be hewn down and cast into the fire;
