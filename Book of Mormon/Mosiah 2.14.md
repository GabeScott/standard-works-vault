# Mosiah 2:14

> And even I, myself, have <u>labored</u>[^a] with mine own <u>hands</u>[^b] that I might serve you, and that ye should not be <u>laden</u>[^c] with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne—and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.
