# Alma 26:3

> Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how <u>many</u>[^a] of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made <u>instruments</u>[^b] in the hands of God to bring about this great work.
