# Alma 12:37

> And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we <u>provoke</u>[^a] not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the <u>rest</u>[^b] of God, which is prepared according to his word.
