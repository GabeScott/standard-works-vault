# Alma 37:40

> And it did work for them according to their <u>faith</u>[^a] in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.
