# 1 Nephi 17:45

> Ye are <u>swift</u>[^a] to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an <u>angel</u>[^b], and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were <u>past</u>[^c] feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder.
