# Mormon 4:2

> And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the <u>city Desolation</u>[^a], and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.
