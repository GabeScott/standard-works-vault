> And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this, and I have caused my people who are of the house of Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to be <u>slain</u>[^a], and to be cast out from among them, and to become <u>hated</u>[^b] by them, and to become a hiss and a byword among them—
