# Ether 2:11

> And this cometh unto you, O ye <u>Gentiles</u>[^a], that ye may know the decrees of Godâ€”that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the <u>wrath</u>[^b] of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done.
