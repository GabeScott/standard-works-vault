# Mosiah 9:1

> <u>I</u>[^a], <u>Zeniff</u>[^b], having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of <u>Nephi</u>[^c], or of the land of our fathers’ first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them—but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.
