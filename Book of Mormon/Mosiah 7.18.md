# Mosiah 7:18

> And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he <u>spake</u>[^a] unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there <u>remaineth</u>[^b] an effectual struggle to be made.
