# Alma 12:23

> And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have <u>partaken</u>[^a] of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: <u>If</u>[^b] thou eat thou shalt surely die.
