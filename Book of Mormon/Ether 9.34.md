# Ether 9:34

> And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of the beasts, and did devour the <u>carcasses</u>[^a] of them which fell by the way, until they had devoured them all. Now when the people saw that they must <u>perish</u>[^b] they began to <u>repent</u>[^c] of their iniquities and cry unto the Lord.
