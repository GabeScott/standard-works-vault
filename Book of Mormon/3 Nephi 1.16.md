# 3 Nephi 1:16

> And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who <u>fell</u>[^a] to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great <u>plan</u>[^b] of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.
