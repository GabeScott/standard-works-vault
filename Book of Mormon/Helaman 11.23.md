# Helaman 11:23

> And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many <u>revelations</u>[^a] daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that same year.
