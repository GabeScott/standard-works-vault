# Alma 43:20

> Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only their <u>swords</u>[^a] and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their <u>stones</u>[^b] and their slings; and they were <u>naked</u>[^c], save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the Amalekites;
