# Helaman 15:3

> Yea, wo unto this <u>people</u>[^a] who are called the <u>people</u>[^b] of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he <u>chastened</u>[^c] them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.
