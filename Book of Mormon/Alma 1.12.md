# Alma 1:12

> But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that <u>priestcraft</u>[^a] has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were <u>priestcraft</u>[^b] to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.
