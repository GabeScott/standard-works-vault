# 2 Nephi 9:12

> And this <u>death</u>[^a] of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is <u>hell</u>[^b]; wherefore, death and hell must <u>deliver</u>[^c] up their dead, and hell must deliver up its <u>captive</u>[^d] <u>spirits</u>[^e], and the grave must deliver up its captive <u>bodies</u>[^f], and the bodies and the <u>spirits</u>[^g] of men will be <u>restored</u>[^h] one to the other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.
