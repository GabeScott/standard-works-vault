# Jacob 6:5

> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and <u>cleave</u>[^a] unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his <u>arm</u>[^b] of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts.
