# Mosiah 4:20

> And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a <u>remission</u>[^a] of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his <u>Spirit</u>[^b] upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with <u>joy</u>[^c], and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.
