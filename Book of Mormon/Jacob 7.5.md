# Jacob 7:5

> And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many <u>revelations</u>[^a] and the many things which I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen <u>angels</u>[^b], and they had ministered unto me. And also, I had <u>heard</u>[^c] the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.
