# Words of Mormon 1:2

> And it is <u>many</u>[^a] hundred years after the coming of Christ that I deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire <u>destruction</u>[^b] of my people. But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may <u>profit</u>[^c] them.
