# Mormon 2:3

> And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh year the Lamanites did come upon us with <u>exceedingly</u>[^a] great power, insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore they would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the <u>north</u>[^b] countries.
