# Moroni 9:25

> My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto <u>death</u>[^a]; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and <u>long-suffering</u>[^b], and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your <u>mind</u>[^c] forever.
