# Mormon 9:26

> And now, behold, who can stand <u>against</u>[^a] the works of the Lord? <u>Who</u>[^b] can deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord? Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who will despise the children of Christ? Behold, all ye who are <u>despisers</u>[^c] of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder and perish.
