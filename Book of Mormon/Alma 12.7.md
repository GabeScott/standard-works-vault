# Alma 12:7

> Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they <u>knew</u>[^a] the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.
