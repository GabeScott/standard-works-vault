# 3 Nephi 9:9

> And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire because of their sins and their <u>wickedness</u>[^a], which was above all the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their <u>secret</u>[^b] murders and combinations; for it was they that did <u>destroy</u>[^c] the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be burned, to <u>destroy</u>[^d] them from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them.
