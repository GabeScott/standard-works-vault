# 1 Nephi 16:10

> And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he beheld upon the ground a round <u>ball</u>[^a] of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and the one <u>pointed</u>[^b] the way whither we should go into the wilderness.
