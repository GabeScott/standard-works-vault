# Omni 1:3

> And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had many <u>seasons</u>[^a] of serious war and bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept these plates according to the <u>commandments</u>[^b] of my <u>fathers</u>[^c]; and I <u>conferred</u>[^d] them upon my son Amaron. And I make an end.
