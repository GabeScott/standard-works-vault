# Alma 34:9

> For it is expedient that an <u>atonement</u>[^a] should be made; for according to the great <u>plan</u>[^b] of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are <u>fallen</u>[^c] and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.
