# Alma 34:8

> And now, behold, I will <u>testify</u>[^a] unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the <u>transgressions</u>[^b] of his people, and that he shall <u>atone</u>[^c] for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
