# Alma 27:12

> Get this people <u>out</u>[^a] of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will <u>preserve</u>[^b] them.
