# Alma 26:28

> And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the worldâ€”not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.
