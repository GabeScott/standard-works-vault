# Alma 10:28

> And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a <u>child</u>[^a] of the devil, for he hath <u>lied</u>[^b] unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it.
