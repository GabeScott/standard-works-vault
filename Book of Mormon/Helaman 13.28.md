# Helaman 13:28

> Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh <u>flattering</u>[^a] words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him.
