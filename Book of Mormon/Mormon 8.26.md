# Mormon 8:26

> And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for <u>out</u>[^a] of the earth shall they come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that <u>miracles</u>[^b] are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak <u>from the dead</u>[^c] .
