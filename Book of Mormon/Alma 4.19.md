# Alma 4:19

> And this he did that he <u>himself</u>[^a] might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might <u>preach</u>[^b] the <u>word</u>[^c] of God unto them, to <u>stir</u>[^d] them up in <u>remembrance</u>[^e] of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure <u>testimony</u>[^f] against them.
