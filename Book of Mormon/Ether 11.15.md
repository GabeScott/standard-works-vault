# Ether 11:15

> And it came to pass that there arose a <u>rebellion</u>[^a] among the people, because of that secret <u>combination</u>[^b] which was built up to get power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.
