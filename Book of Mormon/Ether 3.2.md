# Ether 3:2

> O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be <u>angry</u>[^a] with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are <u>unworthy</u>[^b] before thee; because of the <u>fall</u>[^c] our <u>natures</u>[^d] have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.
