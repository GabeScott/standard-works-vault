# 2 Nephi 12:16

> And upon all the ships of the <u>sea</u>[^a], and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

[^a]: The Greek (Septuagint) has “ships of the sea.” The Hebrew has “ships of Tarshish.” The Book of Mormon has both, showing that the brass plates had lost neither phrase.
