# Ether 3:26

> For he had said unto him in times before, that <u>if</u>[^a] he would <u>believe</u>[^b] in him that he could show unto him <u>all</u>[^c] thingsâ€”it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.
