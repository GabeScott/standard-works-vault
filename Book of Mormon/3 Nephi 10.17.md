# 3 Nephi 10:17

> Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a <u>remnant</u>[^a] of the seed of Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And these things which testify of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?
