# Alma 40:15

> Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the <u>raising</u>[^a] of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.
