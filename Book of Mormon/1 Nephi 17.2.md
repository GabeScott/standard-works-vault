# 1 Nephi 17:2

> And so great were the <u>blessings</u>[^a] of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon <u>raw</u>[^b] <u>meat</u>[^c] in the wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without murmurings.
