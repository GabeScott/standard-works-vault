# 2 Nephi 29:5

> O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have <u>cursed</u>[^a] them, and have <u>hated</u>[^b] them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.
