# Alma 13:12

> Now they, after being <u>sanctified</u>[^a] by the <u>Holy Ghost</u>[^b], having their garments made white, being <u>pure</u>[^c] and spotless before God, could not look upon <u>sin</u>[^d] save it were with <u>abhorrence</u>[^e]; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.
