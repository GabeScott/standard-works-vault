# Helaman 5:44

> And <u>Nephi</u>[^a] and <u>Lehi</u>[^b] were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that <u>joy</u>[^c] which is unspeakable and full of glory.
