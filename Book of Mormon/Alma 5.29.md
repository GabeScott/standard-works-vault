# Alma 5:29

> Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of <u>envy</u>[^a] ? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should prepare <u>quickly</u>[^b], for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.
