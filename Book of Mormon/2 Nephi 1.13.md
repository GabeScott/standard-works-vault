# 2 Nephi 1:13

> O that ye would awake; awake from a deep <u>sleep</u>[^a], yea, even from the sleep of <u>hell</u>[^b], and shake off the awful <u>chains</u>[^c] by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal <u>gulf</u>[^d] of misery and woe.
