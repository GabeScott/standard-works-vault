# 1 Nephi 1:13

> And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine <u>abominations</u>[^a] ! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning <u>Jerusalem</u>[^b] â€”that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be <u>carried away</u>[^c] captive into Babylon.
