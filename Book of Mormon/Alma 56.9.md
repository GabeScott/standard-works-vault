# Alma 56:9

> But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these <u>two thousand</u>[^a] young men to the city of <u>Judea</u>[^b], to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.
