# Alma 62:6

> And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the <u>king</u>[^a] of those dissenters who had driven the <u>freemen</u>[^b] out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.
