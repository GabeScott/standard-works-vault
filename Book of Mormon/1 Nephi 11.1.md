# 1 Nephi 11:1

> For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat <u>pondering</u>[^a] in mine heart I was <u>caught away</u>[^b] in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high <u>mountain</u>[^c], which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.
