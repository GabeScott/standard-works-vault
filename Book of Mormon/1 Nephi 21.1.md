# 1 Nephi 21:1

> <u>And</u>[^a] again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O <u>isles</u>[^b], unto me, and hearken ye people from <u>far</u>[^c]; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
