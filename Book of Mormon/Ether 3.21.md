# Ether 3:21

> And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the <u>time</u>[^a] cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall <u>treasure</u>[^b] up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.
