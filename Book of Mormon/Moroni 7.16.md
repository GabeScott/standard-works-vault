# Moroni 7:16

> For behold, the <u>Spirit of Christ</u>[^a] is given to every <u>man</u>[^b], that he may <u>know</u>[^c] good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.
