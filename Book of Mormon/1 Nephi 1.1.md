# 1 Nephi 1:1

> I, Nephi, having been <u>born</u>[^a] of <u>goodly</u>[^b] <u>parents</u>[^c], therefore I was <u>taught</u>[^d] somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many <u>afflictions</u>[^e] in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a <u>record</u>[^f] of my proceedings in my days.
