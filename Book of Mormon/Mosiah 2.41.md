# Mosiah 2:41

> And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and <u>happy</u>[^a] state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are <u>blessed</u>[^b] in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out <u>faithful</u>[^c] to the end they are received into <u>heaven</u>[^d], that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
