# Mosiah 16:5

> But remember that he that persists in his own <u>carnal</u>[^a] nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the <u>devil</u>[^b] hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no <u>redemption</u>[^c] made, being an enemy to God; and also is the <u>devil</u>[^d] an enemy to God.
