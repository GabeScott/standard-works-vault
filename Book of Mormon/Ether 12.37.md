# Ether 12:37

> And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made <u>clean</u>[^a] . And because thou hast seen thy <u>weakness</u>[^b] thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.
