# 2 Nephi 9:30

> But wo unto the <u>rich</u>[^a], who are <u>rich</u>[^b] as to the things of the <u>world</u>[^c] . For because they are rich they despise the <u>poor</u>[^d], and they persecute the meek, and their <u>hearts</u>[^e] are upon their treasures; wherefore, their <u>treasure</u>[^f] is their god. And behold, their <u>treasure</u>[^g] shall perish with them also.
