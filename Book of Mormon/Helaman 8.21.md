# Helaman 8:21

> And now will you dispute that <u>Jerusalem</u>[^a] was destroyed? Will ye say that the <u>sons</u>[^b] of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were <u>Mulek</u>[^c] ? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not allâ€”
