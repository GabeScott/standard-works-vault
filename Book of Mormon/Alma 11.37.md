# Alma 11:37

> And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their <u>sins</u>[^a]; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that <u>no unclean thing</u>[^b] can inherit the <u>kingdom</u>[^c] of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.
