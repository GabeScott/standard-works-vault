# Alma 24:14

> And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our <u>souls</u>[^a] as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the <u>plan of salvation</u>[^b] might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.
