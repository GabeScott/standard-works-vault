# 3 Nephi 17:7

> Have ye any that are <u>sick</u>[^a] among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or <u>leprous</u>[^b], or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will <u>heal</u>[^c] them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.
