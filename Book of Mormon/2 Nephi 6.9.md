# 2 Nephi 6:9

> Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should <u>return</u>[^a] again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should <u>scourge</u>[^b] him and <u>crucify</u>[^c] him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.
