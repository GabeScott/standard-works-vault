# Alma 46:7

> And there were many in the church who believed in the <u>flattering</u>[^a] words of Amalickiah, therefore they <u>dissented</u>[^b] even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great <u>victory</u>[^c] which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their <u>deliverance</u>[^d] by the hand of the Lord.
