# Alma 16:9

> And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were <u>destroyed</u>[^a]; yea, <u>every</u>[^b] living soul of the Ammonihahites was <u>destroyed</u>[^c], and also their <u>great</u>[^d] city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.
