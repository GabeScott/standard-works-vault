> Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your <u>synagogues</u>[^a], or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall <u>heal</u>[^b] them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.
