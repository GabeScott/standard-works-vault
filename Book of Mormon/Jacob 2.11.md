# Jacob 2:11

> Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the <u>plainness</u>[^a] of the <u>word</u>[^b] of God. For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.
