# Alma 52:19

> And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the chief <u>captains</u>[^a] held a council of warâ€”what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek.
