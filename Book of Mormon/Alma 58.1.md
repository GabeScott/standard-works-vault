# Alma 58:1

> And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not <u>decoy</u>[^a] them away from their strongholds.
