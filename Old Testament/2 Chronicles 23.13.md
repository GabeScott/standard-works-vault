# 2 Chronicles 23:13

> And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to <u>sing</u>[^a] praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
