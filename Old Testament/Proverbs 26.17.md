# Proverbs 26:17

> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that <u>taketh</u>[^a] a dog by the ears.

[Proverbs 26:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/26.17?lang=eng#p17)


[^a]: Dogs were not pets in Israel, but typically ran wild; one seized by the ears would certainly bite its attacker.
