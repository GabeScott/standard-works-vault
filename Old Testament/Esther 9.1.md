> Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the kingâ€™s <u>commandment</u>[^a] and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
