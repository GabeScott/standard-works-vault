# 2 Samuel 21:2

> And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the <u>Gibeonites</u>[^a] were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
