# Ezekiel 3:18

> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely <u>die</u>[^a]; and thou givest him not <u>warning</u>[^b], nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall <u>die</u>[^c] in his <u>iniquity</u>[^d]; but his blood will I <u>require</u>[^e] at thine hand.
