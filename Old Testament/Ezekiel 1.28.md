# Ezekiel 1:28

> As the appearance of the <u>bow</u>[^a] that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the <u>appearance</u>[^b] of the likeness of the <u>glory</u>[^c] of the Lord . And when I saw it, I <u>fell</u>[^e] upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
