# Daniel 2:45

> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the <u>stone</u>[^a] was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made <u>known</u>[^b] to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
