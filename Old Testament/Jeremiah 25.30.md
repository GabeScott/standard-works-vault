> Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily <u>roar</u>[^a] upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
