# Ezekiel 31:14

> To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to <u>the</u>[^a] nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
