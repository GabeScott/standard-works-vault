# Daniel 2:35

> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no <u>place</u>[^a] was found for them: and the <u>stone</u>[^b] that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
