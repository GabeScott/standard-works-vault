# Daniel 7:7

> After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth <u>beast</u>[^a], dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great <u>iron</u>[^b] teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had <u>ten</u>[^c] horns.
