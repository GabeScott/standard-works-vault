# Daniel 4:18

> This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the <u>spirit</u>[^a] of the <u>holy</u>[^b] gods is in thee.
