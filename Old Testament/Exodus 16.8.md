# Exodus 16:8

> And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your <u>murmurings</u>[^a] are not against us, but <u>against</u>[^b] the Lord .
