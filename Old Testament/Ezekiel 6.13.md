# Ezekiel 6:13

> Then shall ye know that I am the Lord , when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their <u>idols</u>[^a] .
