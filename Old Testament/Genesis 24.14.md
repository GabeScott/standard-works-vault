> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast <u>appointed</u>[^a] for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
