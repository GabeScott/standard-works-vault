# 1 Chronicles 5:1

> Now the sons of <u>Reuben</u>[^a] the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his fatherâ€™s <u>bed</u>[^b], his birthright was given unto the <u>sons</u>[^c] of <u>Joseph</u>[^d] the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
