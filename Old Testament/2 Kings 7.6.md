# 2 Kings 7:6

> For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of <u>chariots</u>[^a], and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
