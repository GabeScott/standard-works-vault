# 1 Kings 14:19

> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the <u>book</u>[^a] of the <u>chronicles</u>[^b] of the kings of Israel.

[1 Kings 14:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14.19?lang=eng#p19)


[^a]: It is significant that the kings of Israel and Judah kept official records; these records are no longer extant; they were used as source books by the author(s) of our books of Kings; they are not our books of Chronicles.  
[^b]: [[1 Chronicles 27.24|1Â Chr. 27:24]].
