# Ruth 4:4

> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, <u>Buy</u>[^a] it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt <u>redeem</u>[^b] it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
