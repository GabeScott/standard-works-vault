# Exodus 32:8

> They have <u>turned</u>[^a] aside <u>quickly</u>[^b] out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a <u>molten</u>[^c] calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
