# Isaiah 24:16

> Â¶ From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, <u>My</u>[^a] leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, <u>the</u>[^b] treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

[Isaiah 24:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.16?lang=eng#p16)


[^a]: HEB I waste away! Woe is me!
[^b]: Despite the rejoicing of the remnant, the prophet laments the destruction of the many peoples who rejected righteousness (vv. 16-18).
