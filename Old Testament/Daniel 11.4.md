# Daniel 11:4

> And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be <u>broken</u>[^a], and shall be divided toward the <u>four</u>[^b] <u>winds</u>[^c] of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
