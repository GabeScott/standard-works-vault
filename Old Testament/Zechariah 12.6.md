# Zechariah 12:6

> Â¶ In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an <u>hearth</u>[^a] of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the <u>people</u>[^b] round about, on the right hand and on the left: and <u>Jerusalem</u>[^c] shall be <u>inhabited</u>[^d] again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
