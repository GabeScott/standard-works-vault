# Ezekiel 39:17

> ¶ And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God ; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every <u>beast</u>[^a] of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
