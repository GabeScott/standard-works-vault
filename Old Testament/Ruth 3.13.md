# Ruth 3:13

> Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the <u>part</u>[^a] of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmanâ€™s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth: lie down until the morning.
