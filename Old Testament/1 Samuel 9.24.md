# 1 Samuel 9:24

> And the cook took up the <u>shoulder</u>[^a], and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
