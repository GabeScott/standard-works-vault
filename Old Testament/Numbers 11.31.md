# Numbers 11:31

> ¶ And there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought <u>quails</u>[^a] from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
