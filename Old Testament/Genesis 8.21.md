# Genesis 8:21

> And the Lord smelled a sweet <u>savour</u>[^a]; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again <u>curse</u>[^b] the ground any more <u>for man’s sake</u>[^c]; for the <u>imagination</u>[^d] of man’s heart is <u>evil</u>[^e] from his youth; neither will I again <u>smite</u>[^f] any more every thing living, as I have done.
