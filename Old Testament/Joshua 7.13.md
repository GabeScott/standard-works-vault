# Joshua 7:13

> Up, <u>sanctify</u>[^a] the people, and say, <u>Sanctify</u>[^b] yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
