# Job 42:8

> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt <u>offering</u>[^a]; and my servant Job shall <u>pray</u>[^b] for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
