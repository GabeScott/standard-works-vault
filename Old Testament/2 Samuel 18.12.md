# 2 Samuel 18:12

> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the kingâ€™s son: for in our hearing the king <u>charged</u>[^a] thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
