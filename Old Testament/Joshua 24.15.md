# Joshua 24:15

> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord , <u>choose</u>[^a] you <u>this day</u>[^b] whom ye will <u>serve</u>[^c]; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my <u>house</u>[^d], we will <u>serve</u>[^e] the Lord .
