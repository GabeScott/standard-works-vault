# Ecclesiastes 9:2

> All things come alike to all: there is one <u>event</u>[^a] to the <u>righteous</u>[^b], and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that <u>sweareth</u>[^c], as he that <u>feareth an oath</u>[^d] .
