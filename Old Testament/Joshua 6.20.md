# Joshua 6:20

> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the <u>wall</u>[^a] fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
