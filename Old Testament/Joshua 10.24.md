# Joshua 10:24

> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and <u>put</u>[^a] their feet upon the necks of them.
