# Ezekiel 34:10

> Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will <u>require</u>[^a] my flock at their hand, and cause them to <u>cease</u>[^b] from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
