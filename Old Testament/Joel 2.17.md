# Joel 2:17

> Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord , <u>weep</u>[^a] between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy <u>people</u>[^b], O Lord , and give not thine heritage to <u>reproach</u>[^c], that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?
