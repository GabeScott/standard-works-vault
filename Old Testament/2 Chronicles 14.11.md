# 2 Chronicles 14:11

> And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord , it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O Lord , thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
