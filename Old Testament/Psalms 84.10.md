# Psalms 84:10

> For a day in thy courts is better than <u>a thousand</u>[^a] . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

[Psalms 84:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/84.10?lang=eng#p10)


[^a]: IE a thousand elsewhere.
