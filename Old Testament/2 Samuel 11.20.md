# 2 Samuel 11:20

> And if so be that the king’s <u>wrath</u>[^a] arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

[2 Samuel 11:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/11.20?lang=eng#p20)


[^a]: Joab had not followed the king’s plan (see v. 15) but sent Uriah and his men right up to the city gate and wall. He feared David might be angry because so many were killed with Uriah.
