# Leviticus 10:6

> And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your <u>heads</u>[^a], neither <u>rend</u>[^b] your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.
