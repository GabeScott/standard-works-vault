# Daniel 2:5

> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is <u>gone from me</u>[^a] : if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be <u>cut</u>[^b] in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

[^a]: Persian: sure with me; i.e., he knew his dream and desired to test them. See vv. 8-9.
[^b]: Dan. 3:29.
