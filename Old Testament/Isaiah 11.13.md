# Isaiah 11:13

> The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not <u>envy</u>[^a] <u>Judah</u>[^b], and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

[Isaiah 11:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11.13?lang=eng#p13)


[^a]: The tribes led by Judah and Ephraim were historically adversaries (after events of 1 Kgs. 12:16-20). In the latter days this enmity will be healed. TG [[Envy, Envious]].
[^b]: TG [[Israel, Judah, People of]].
