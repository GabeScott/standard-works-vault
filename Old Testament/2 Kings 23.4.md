> And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the <u>priests</u>[^a] of the second order, and the <u>keepers</u>[^b] of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el.
