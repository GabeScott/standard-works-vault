# 1 Kings 2:5

> Moreover thou knowest also what <u>Joab</u>[^a] the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto <u>Abner</u>[^b] the son of Ner, and unto <u>Amasa</u>[^c] the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
