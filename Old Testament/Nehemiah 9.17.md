# Nehemiah 9:17

> And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to <u>return</u>[^a] to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to <u>pardon</u>[^b], gracious and <u>merciful</u>[^c], slow to <u>anger</u>[^d], and of great <u>kindness</u>[^e], and forsookest them not.
