# Esther 7:4

> For we are <u>sold</u>[^a], I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, <u>although</u>[^b] the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.

[Esther 7:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/7.4?lang=eng#p4)


[^a]: [[Esther 3.9|Esth. 3:9]]; [[Esther 4.7|4:7.]]
[^b]: HEB for that would not have damaged the king’s interests.
