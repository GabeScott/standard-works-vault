# 1 Chronicles 28:9

> ¶ And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a <u>perfect heart</u>[^a] and with a willing mind: for the Lord <u>searcheth</u>[^b] all hearts, and <u>understandeth</u>[^c] all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou <u>seek</u>[^d] him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
