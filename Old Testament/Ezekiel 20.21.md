# Ezekiel 20:21

> Notwithstanding the children <u>rebelled</u>[^a] against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
