# 2 Chronicles 13:9

> Have ye not <u>cast out</u>[^a] the priests of the Lord , the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young <u>bullock</u>[^b] and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
