# 2 Kings 20:13

> And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his <u>treasures</u>[^a] : there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
