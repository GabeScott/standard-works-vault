# Judges 10:6

> Â¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord , and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the Lord , and served not him.
