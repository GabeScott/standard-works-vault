# Isaiah 51:3

> For the Lord shall <u>comfort</u>[^a] <u>Zion</u>[^b] : he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like <u>Eden</u>[^c], and her desert like the <u>garden</u>[^d] of the Lord ; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
