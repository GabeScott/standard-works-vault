# 1 Samuel 10:19

> And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your <u>adversities</u>[^a] and your <u>tribulations</u>[^b]; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a <u>king</u>[^c] over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes, and by your thousands.
