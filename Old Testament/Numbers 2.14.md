> Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of <u>Reuel</u>[^a] .

[Numbers 2:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/2.14?lang=eng#p14)


[^a]: Deuel in [[Numbers 1.14|Num. 1:14]]; [[Numbers 7.42|7:42, 47]][[Numbers 7.47|]]; [[Numbers 10.20|10:20]]. Hebrew “r” and “d” look much alike.
