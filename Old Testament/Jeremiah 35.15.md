# Jeremiah 35:15

> I have sent also unto you all my servants the <u>prophets</u>[^a], rising up early and sending them, saying, <u>Return</u>[^b] ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
