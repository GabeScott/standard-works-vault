> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the kingâ€™s <u>daughters</u>[^a], and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
