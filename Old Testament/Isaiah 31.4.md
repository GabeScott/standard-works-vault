# Isaiah 31:4

> For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me, Like as the <u>lion</u>[^a] and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to <u>fight</u>[^b] for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
