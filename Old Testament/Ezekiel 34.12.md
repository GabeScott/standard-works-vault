# Ezekiel 34:12

> As a <u>shepherd</u>[^a] seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I <u>seek</u>[^b] out my <u>sheep</u>[^c], and will deliver them out of all places where they have been <u>scattered</u>[^d] in the <u>cloudy</u>[^e] and <u>dark</u>[^f] day.
