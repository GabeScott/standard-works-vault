# Esther 1:19

> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not <u>altered</u>[^a], That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
