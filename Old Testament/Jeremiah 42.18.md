# Jeremiah 42:18

> For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an <u>execration</u>[^a], and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
