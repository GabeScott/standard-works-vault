# Deuteronomy 20:19

> ¶ When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down ( <u>for</u>[^a] the tree of the field is man’s life ) to employ them in the siege:

[Deuteronomy 20:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/20.19?lang=eng#p19)


[^a]: HEB for are the trees in the field men, that you should besiege them?
