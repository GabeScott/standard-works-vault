# Ecclesiastes 8:17

> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the <u>work</u>[^a] that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a <u>wise</u>[^b] man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
