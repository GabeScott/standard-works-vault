# Exodus 34:10

> ¶ And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do <u>marvels</u>[^a], such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord : for it is a <u>terrible</u>[^b] thing that I will do with thee.
