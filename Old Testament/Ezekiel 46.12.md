# Ezekiel 46:12

> Now when the prince shall prepare a <u>voluntary</u>[^a] burnt offering or peace <u>offerings</u>[^b] <u>voluntarily</u>[^c] unto the Lord , one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
