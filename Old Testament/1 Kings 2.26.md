# 1 Kings 2:26

> ¶ And unto <u>Abiathar</u>[^a] the priest said the king, Get thee to <u>Anathoth</u>[^b], unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
