# Numbers 20:17

> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
