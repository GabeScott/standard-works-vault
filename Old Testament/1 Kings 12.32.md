# 1 Kings 12:32

> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the <u>feast</u>[^a] that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the <u>priests</u>[^b] of the high places which he had made.
