# Nehemiah 2:14

> Then I went on to the <u>gate</u>[^a] of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

[Nehemiah 2:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/2.14?lang=eng#p14)


[^a]: Perhaps a gate near En-rogel. The king’s pool could be Siloam. Neh. 3:15; 12:37.
