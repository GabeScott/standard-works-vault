# Isaiah 9:1

> <u>Nevertheless</u>[^a] the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, <u>when</u>[^b] at the first he lightly afflicted the land of <u>Zebulun</u>[^c] and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
