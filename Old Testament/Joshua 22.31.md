# Joshua 22:31

> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the Lord is <u>among</u>[^a] us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the Lord : now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord .
