# 2 Kings 3:25

> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in <u>Kir-haraseth</u>[^a] left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.
