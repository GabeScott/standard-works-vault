# Jeremiah 44:12

> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their <u>faces</u>[^a] to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be <u>consumed</u>[^b], and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an <u>execration</u>[^c], and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
