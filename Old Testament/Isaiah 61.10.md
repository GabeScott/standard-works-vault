# Isaiah 61:10

> I will greatly rejoice in the Lord , my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath <u>clothed</u>[^a] me with the <u>garments</u>[^b] of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
