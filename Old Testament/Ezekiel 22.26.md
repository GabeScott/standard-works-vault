# Ezekiel 22:26

> Her <u>priests</u>[^a] have <u>violated</u>[^b] my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no <u>difference</u>[^c] between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my <u>sabbaths</u>[^d], and I am <u>profaned</u>[^e] among them.
