# 2 Kings 2:16

> ¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the <u>Spirit</u>[^a] of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
