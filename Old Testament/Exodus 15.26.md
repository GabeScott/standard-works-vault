# Exodus 15:26

> And said, If thou wilt <u>diligently</u>[^a] <u>hearken</u>[^b] to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and <u>keep</u>[^c] all his statutes, I will put none of these <u>diseases</u>[^d] upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that <u>healeth</u>[^e] thee.
