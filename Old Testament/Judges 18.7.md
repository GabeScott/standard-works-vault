# Judges 18:7

> ¶ Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt <u>careless</u>[^a], after the manner of the Zidonians, <u>quiet</u>[^b] and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
