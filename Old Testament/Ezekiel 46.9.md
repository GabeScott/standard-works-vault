# Ezekiel 46:9

> Â¶ But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord in the solemn <u>feasts</u>[^a], he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.
