# 2 Kings 3:13

> And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with <u>thee</u>[^a] ? <u>get</u>[^b] thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the Lord hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
