# Ezekiel 18:24

> Â¶ But when the <u>righteous</u>[^a] <u>turneth</u>[^b] away from his <u>righteousness</u>[^c], and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his <u>sin</u>[^d] that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
