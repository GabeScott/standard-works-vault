# Ezra 8:22

> For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for <u>good</u>[^a] that <u>seek</u>[^b] him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
