# Exodus 13:15

> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord <u>slew</u>[^a] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
