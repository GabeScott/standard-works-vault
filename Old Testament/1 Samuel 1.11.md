> And she <u>vowed</u>[^a] a <u>vow</u>[^b], and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine <u>handmaid</u>[^c], and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no <u>razor</u>[^d] come upon his head.
