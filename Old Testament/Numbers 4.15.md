# Numbers 4:15

> And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of <u>Kohath</u>[^a] shall come to <u>bear</u>[^b] it: but they shall not <u>touch</u>[^c] any <u>holy</u>[^e] thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.
