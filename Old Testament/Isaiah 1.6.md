# Isaiah 1:6

> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been <u>closed</u>[^a], neither bound up, neither <u>mollified</u>[^b] with ointment.

[Isaiah 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1.6?lang=eng#p6)


[^a]: HEB squeezed out.
[^b]: HEB softened.
