# Joel 2:20

> But I will <u>remove</u>[^a] far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the <u>east</u>[^b] sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his <u>stink</u>[^c] shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.
