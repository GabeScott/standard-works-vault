# Leviticus 10:19

> And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord ; and such things have <u>befallen</u>[^a] me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been <u>accepted</u>[^b] in the sight of the Lord ?
