# Jeremiah 3:16

> And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the Lord , they shall say no more, The <u>ark</u>[^a] of the covenant of the Lord : neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.
