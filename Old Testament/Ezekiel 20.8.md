# Ezekiel 20:8

> But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my <u>fury</u>[^a] upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
