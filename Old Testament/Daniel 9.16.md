# Daniel 9:16

> Â¶ O Lord, according to all thy <u>righteousness</u>[^a], I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy <u>mountain</u>[^b] : because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a <u>reproach</u>[^c] to all that are about us.
