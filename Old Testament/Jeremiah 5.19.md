# Jeremiah 5:19

> Â¶ And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have <u>forsaken</u>[^a] me, and served strange <u>gods</u>[^b] in your land, so shall ye <u>serve</u>[^c] <u>strangers</u>[^d] in a land that is not yours.
