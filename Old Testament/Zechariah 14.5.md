# Zechariah 14:5

> And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the <u>earthquake</u>[^a] in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the <u>saints</u>[^b] with thee.
