# Ezekiel 6:9

> And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a <u>whoring</u>[^a] after their idols: and they shall <u>lothe</u>[^b] themselves for the <u>evils</u>[^c] which they have committed in all their abominations.
