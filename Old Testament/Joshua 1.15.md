# Joshua 1:15

> Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord ’s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.
