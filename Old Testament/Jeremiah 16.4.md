# Jeremiah 16:4

> They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be <u>lamented</u>[^a]; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be <u>consumed</u>[^b] by the sword, and by famine; and their <u>carcases</u>[^c] shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
