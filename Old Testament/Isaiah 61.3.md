# Isaiah 61:3

> To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them <u>beauty</u>[^a] for ashes, the oil of <u>joy</u>[^b] for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called <u>trees</u>[^c] of <u>righteousness</u>[^d], the <u>planting</u>[^e] of the Lord , that he might be glorified.
