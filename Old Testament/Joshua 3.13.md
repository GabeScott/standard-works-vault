> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord , the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an <u>heap</u>[^a] .
