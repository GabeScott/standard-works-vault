# Ezekiel 42:13

> ¶ Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the <u>priests</u>[^a] that approach unto the Lord shall <u>eat</u>[^b] the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the <u>meat offering</u>[^c], and the <u>sin offering</u>[^d], and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
