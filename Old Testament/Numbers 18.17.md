# Numbers 18:17

> But the <u>firstling</u>[^a] of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt <u>sprinkle</u>[^b] their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the Lord .
