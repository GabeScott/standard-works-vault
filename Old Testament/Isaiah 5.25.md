# Isaiah 5:25

> Therefore is the <u>anger</u>[^a] of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath <u>stretched</u>[^b] forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
