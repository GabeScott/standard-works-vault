# Ezekiel 20:13

> But the house of Israel <u>rebelled</u>[^a] against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they <u>despised</u>[^b] my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the <u>wilderness</u>[^c], to consume them.
