# Malachi 3:5

> And I will come near to you to <u>judgment</u>[^a]; and I will be a swift witness against the <u>sorcerers</u>[^b], and against the <u>adulterers</u>[^c], and against <u>false</u>[^d] swearers, and against those that <u>oppress</u>[^e] the hireling in his <u>wages</u>[^f], the <u>widow</u>[^g], and the fatherless, and that turn aside the <u>stranger</u>[^h] from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.
