# Daniel 12:7

> And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and <u>sware</u>[^a] by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to <u>scatter</u>[^b] the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
