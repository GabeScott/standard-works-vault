# 2 Samuel 3:8

> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a <u>dogâ€™s</u>[^a] head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?
