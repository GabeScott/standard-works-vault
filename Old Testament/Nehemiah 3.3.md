# Nehemiah 3:3

> But the <u>fish gate</u>[^a] did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

[Nehemiah 3:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/3.3?lang=eng#p3)


[^a]: Probably a northwestern gate, with access to the merchantsâ€™ quarter; perhaps where Damascus gate now is. [[Nehemiah 12.39|Neh. 12:39]].
