# Esther 4:11

> All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner <u>court</u>[^a], who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to <u>death</u>[^b], except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden <u>sceptre</u>[^c], that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
