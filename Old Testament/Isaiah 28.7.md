# Isaiah 28:7

> ¶ But <u>they</u>[^a] also have <u>erred</u>[^b] through <u>wine</u>[^c], and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the <u>prophet</u>[^d] have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
