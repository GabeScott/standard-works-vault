# 2 Kings 19:23

> By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the <u>multitude</u>[^a] of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
