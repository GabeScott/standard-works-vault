# Joshua 18:7

> But the <u>Levites</u>[^a] have no part among you; for the priesthood of the Lord is their <u>inheritance</u>[^b] : and Gad, and <u>Reuben</u>[^c], and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.
