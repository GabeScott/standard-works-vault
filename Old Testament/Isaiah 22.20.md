# Isaiah 22:20

> ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will <u>call</u>[^a] my servant <u>Eliakim</u>[^b] the son of Hilkiah:

[Isaiah 22:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/22.20?lang=eng#p20)


[^a]: IE Eliakim shall replace Shebna. Moreover, the symbolic name “Eliakim” in ensuing verses becomes representative of the Messiah, the Savior, especially [[Isaiah 22.23|vv. 23–25]][[Isaiah 22.24|]][[Isaiah 22.25|]]. The name means “God shall cause to arise.”  
[^b]: [[2 Kings 18.18|2 Kgs. 18:18]].
