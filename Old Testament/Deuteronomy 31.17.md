# Deuteronomy 31:17

> Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will <u>hide</u>[^a] my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
