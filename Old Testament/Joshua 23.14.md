> And, behold, this day I am going the <u>way</u>[^a] of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the <u>good</u>[^b] things which the Lord your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.
