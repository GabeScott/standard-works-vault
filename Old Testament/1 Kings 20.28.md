# 1 Kings 20:28

> Â¶ And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord , Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord .
