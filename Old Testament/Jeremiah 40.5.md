# Jeremiah 40:5

> Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to <u>Gedaliah</u>[^a] the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him <u>victuals</u>[^b] and a reward, and let him go.
