# Isaiah 2:16

> <u>And</u>[^a] upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

[Isaiah 2:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/2.16?lang=eng#p16)


[^a]: The Greek (Septuagint) version has one phrase that the Hebrew does not, and the Hebrew has one phrase that the Greek does not; but [[2 Nephi 12.16|2Â Ne. 12:16]] has both. [[Psalms 48.7|Ps. 48:7]]; [[Ezekiel 27.25|Ezek. 27:25]].
