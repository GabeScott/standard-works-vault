# Leviticus 13:55

> And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; <u>it</u>[^a] is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

[^a]: HEBÂ it is a decay, whether it be bald in the head thereof, or in the forehead thereof.
