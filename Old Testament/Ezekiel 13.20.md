# Ezekiel 13:20

> Wherefore thus saith the Lord God ; Behold, I am against your <u>pillows</u>[^a], wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them <u>fly</u>[^b] .

[^a]: HEB bands wherewith ye trap souls.  
[^b]: HEB free.
