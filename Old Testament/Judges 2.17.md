# Judges 2:17

> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a <u>whoring</u>[^a] after other <u>gods</u>[^b], and bowed themselves unto them: they turned <u>quickly</u>[^c] out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the Lord ; but they did not so.
