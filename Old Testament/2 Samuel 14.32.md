# 2 Samuel 14:32

> And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from <u>Geshur</u>[^a] ? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the kingâ€™s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
