# 2 Chronicles 22:11

> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the kingâ€™s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
