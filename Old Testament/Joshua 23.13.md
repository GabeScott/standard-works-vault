# Joshua 23:13

> Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and <u>scourges</u>[^a] in your sides, and <u>thorns</u>[^b] in your eyes, until ye <u>perish</u>[^c] from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.
