# Ezekiel 39:11

> ¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the <u>passengers</u>[^a] on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
