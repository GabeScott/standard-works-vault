# Genesis 17:13

> He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an <u>everlasting covenant</u>[^a] .

[Genesis 17:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/17.13?lang=eng#p13)


[^a]: The covenant is everlasting, but circumcision as a sign of such a covenant was later discontinued. See Acts 15:1, 24-29; Gal. 2:3-4; 5:12-15.
