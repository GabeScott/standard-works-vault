# Haggai 1:6

> Ye have <u>sown</u>[^a] much, and bring in little; ye <u>eat</u>[^b], but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that <u>earneth</u>[^c] wages earneth <u>wages</u>[^d] to put it into a bag with <u>holes</u>[^e] .
