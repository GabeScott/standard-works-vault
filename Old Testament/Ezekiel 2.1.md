# Ezekiel 2:1

> And he said unto me, <u>Son of man</u>[^a], stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

[Ezekiel 2:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/2.1?lang=eng#p1)


[^a]: The expression “son of man” used in Ezekiel refers only to this prophet. As a Hebrew idiom it means simply “human.” It is not to be confused with the title “Son of Man,” which refers to Christ.
