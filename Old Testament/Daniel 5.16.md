# Daniel 5:16

> And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the <u>writing</u>[^a], and make <u>known</u>[^b] to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
