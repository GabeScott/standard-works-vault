# Job 1:5

> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt <u>offerings</u>[^a] according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my <u>sons</u>[^b] have sinned, and <u>cursed</u>[^c] God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
