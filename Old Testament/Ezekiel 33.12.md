# Ezekiel 33:12

> Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his <u>transgression</u>[^a] : as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.
