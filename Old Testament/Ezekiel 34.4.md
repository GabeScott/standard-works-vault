# Ezekiel 34:4

> The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was <u>sick</u>[^a], neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with <u>cruelty</u>[^b] have ye ruled them.
