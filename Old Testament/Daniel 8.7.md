> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was <u>moved</u>[^a] with <u>choler</u>[^b] against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
