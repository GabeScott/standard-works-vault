# Isaiah 38:12

> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have <u>cut off</u>[^a] like a weaver my life: he will cut me off <u>with pining sickness</u>[^b] : from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

[Isaiah 38:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/38.12?lang=eng#p12)


[^a]: [[Job 14.1|Job 14:2 (1–2)]][[Job 14.2|]].  
[^b]: OR as a dangling thread; i.e., when a weaver has finished weaving a piece of cloth, he rolls it up to cut it off the loom.
