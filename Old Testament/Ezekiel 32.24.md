# Ezekiel 32:24

> There is <u>Elam</u>[^a] and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their <u>shame</u>[^b] with them that go down to the pit.
