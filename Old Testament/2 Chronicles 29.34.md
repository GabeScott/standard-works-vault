# 2 Chronicles 29:34

> But the <u>priests</u>[^a] were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had <u>sanctified</u>[^b] themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
