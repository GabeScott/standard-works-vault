# Ezra 3:11

> And they sang together by course in praising and giving <u>thanks</u>[^a] unto the Lord ; because he is <u>good</u>[^b], for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they <u>praised</u>[^c] the Lord , because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.
