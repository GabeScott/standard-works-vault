# Ezekiel 44:7

> In that ye have brought into my sanctuary <u>strangers</u>[^a], uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to <u>pollute</u>[^b] it, even my house, when ye offer my <u>bread</u>[^c], the <u>fat</u>[^d] and the <u>blood</u>[^e], and they have broken my <u>covenant</u>[^f] because of all your abominations.
