# Joshua 23:16

> When ye have <u>transgressed</u>[^a] the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the <u>good</u>[^b] land which he hath given unto you.
