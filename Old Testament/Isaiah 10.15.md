# Isaiah 10:15

> <u>Shall</u>[^a] the axe <u>boast</u>[^b] itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that <u>shaketh</u>[^c] it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.
