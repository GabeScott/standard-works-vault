# Ecclesiastes 9:9

> Live <u>joyfully</u>[^a] with the <u>wife</u>[^b] whom thou <u>lovest</u>[^c] all the days of the life of thy <u>vanity</u>[^d], which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy <u>portion</u>[^e] in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.
