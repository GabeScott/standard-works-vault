# Isaiah 65:16

> That he who <u>blesseth himself</u>[^a] in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall <u>swear</u>[^b] by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

[Isaiah 65:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/65.16?lang=eng#p16)


[^a]: IE invokes blessings in his own behalf.  
[^b]: IE make covenants through the power of God.
