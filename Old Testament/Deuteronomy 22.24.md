# Deuteronomy 22:24

> Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she <u>cried not</u>[^a], being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
