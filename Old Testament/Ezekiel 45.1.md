# Ezekiel 45:1

> Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord , an holy portion of the land: the <u>length</u>[^a] shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.
