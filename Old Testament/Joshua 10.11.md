# Joshua 10:11

> And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great <u>stones</u>[^a] from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
