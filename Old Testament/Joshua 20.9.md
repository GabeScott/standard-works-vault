# Joshua 20:9

> These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the <u>stranger</u>[^a] that <u>sojourneth</u>[^b] among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
