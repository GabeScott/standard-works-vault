# Joshua 9:24

> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to <u>destroy</u>[^a] all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
