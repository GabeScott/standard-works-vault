# 2 Chronicles 34:21

> Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord , to do after all that is written in this <u>book</u>[^a] .
