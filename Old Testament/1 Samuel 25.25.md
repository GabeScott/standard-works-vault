# 1 Samuel 25:25

> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even <u>Nabal</u>[^a] : for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.

[^a]: IEÂ Fool (insensitive, churlish person). Such a name must have been given him by those who knew him.
