# Hosea 2:18

> And in that day will I make a <u>covenant</u>[^a] for them with the <u>beasts</u>[^b] of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down <u>safely</u>[^c] .
