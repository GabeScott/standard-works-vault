# Ezra 5:17

> Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the kingâ€™s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
