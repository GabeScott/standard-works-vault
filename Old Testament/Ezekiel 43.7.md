# Ezekiel 43:7

> Â¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my <u>feet</u>[^a], where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more <u>defile</u>[^b], neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
