# Jeremiah 11:19

> But I was like a <u>lamb</u>[^a] or an ox that is brought to the <u>slaughter</u>[^b]; and I knew not that they had <u>devised</u>[^c] <u>devices</u>[^d] against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us <u>cut him off</u>[^e] from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.
