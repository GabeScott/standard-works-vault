# 1 Samuel 29:4

> And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an <u>adversary</u>[^a] to us: for wherewith should he <u>reconcile</u>[^b] himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?
