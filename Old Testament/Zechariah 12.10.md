# Zechariah 12:10

> And I will <u>pour</u>[^a] upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of <u>grace</u>[^b] and of supplications: and they shall <u>look</u>[^c] upon me whom they have <u>pierced</u>[^d], and they shall <u>mourn</u>[^e] for him, as one mourneth for his <u>only</u>[^f] son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.
