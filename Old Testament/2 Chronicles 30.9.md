# 2 Chronicles 30:9

> For if ye <u>turn</u>[^a] again unto the Lord , your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and <u>merciful</u>[^b], and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
