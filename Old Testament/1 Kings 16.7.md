# 1 Kings 16:7

> And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord , in <u>provoking</u>[^a] him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
