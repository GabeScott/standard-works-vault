# 2 Samuel 24:1

> And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and <u>he</u>[^a] moved David against them to say, Go, <u>number</u>[^b] Israel and Judah.

[2 Samuel 24:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/24.1?lang=eng#p1)


[^a]: Apparently something is missing, and “Satan” should be the antecedent of “he.” See 1 Chr. 21:1.
[^b]: [[Numbers 1.19|Num. 1:19]]; [[1 Chronicles 21.1|1 Chr. 21:1 (1-28).]]
