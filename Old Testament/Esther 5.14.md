# Esther 5:14

> Â¶ Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a <u>gallows</u>[^a] be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow <u>speak</u>[^b] thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
