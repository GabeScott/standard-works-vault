# 2 Samuel 2:23

> Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the <u>fifth</u>[^a] rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where <u>Asahel</u>[^b] fell down and died stood still.
