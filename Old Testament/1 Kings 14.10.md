# 1 Kings 14:10

> Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of <u>Jeroboam</u>[^a], and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will <u>take away</u>[^b] the remnant of the house of <u>Jeroboam</u>[^c], as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
