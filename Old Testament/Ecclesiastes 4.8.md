# Ecclesiastes 4:8

> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and <u>bereave my soul</u>[^a] of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a <u>sore travail</u>[^b] .
