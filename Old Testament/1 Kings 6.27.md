# 1 Kings 6:27

> And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the <u>cherubims</u>[^a], so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
