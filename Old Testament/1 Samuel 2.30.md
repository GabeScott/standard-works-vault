# 1 Samuel 2:30

> Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the <u>house</u>[^a] of thy father, should <u>walk</u>[^b] before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that <u>honour</u>[^c] me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly <u>esteemed</u>[^d] .
