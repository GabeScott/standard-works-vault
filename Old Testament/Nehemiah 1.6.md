# Nehemiah 1:6

> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and <u>confess</u>[^a] the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned.
