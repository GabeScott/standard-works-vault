# Numbers 19:13

> Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord ; and that soul shall be <u>cut off</u>[^a] from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
