# Jonah 4:2

> And he prayed unto the Lord , and said, I pray thee, O Lord , was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and <u>merciful</u>[^a], slow to anger, and of great kindness, and <u>repentest</u>[^b] thee of the evil.

[Jonah 4:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/4.2?lang=eng#p2)


[^a]: TG [[Mercy, Merciful]].
[^b]: HEB relentest; i.e., Jonah knew that God could revoke the calamity decreed, but expected He would do so even without the repentance of the people.
