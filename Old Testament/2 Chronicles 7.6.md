# 2 Chronicles 7:6

> And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the Lord , which David the king had made to praise the Lord , because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
