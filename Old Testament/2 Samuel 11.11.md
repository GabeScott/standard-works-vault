# 2 Samuel 11:11

> And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in <u>tents</u>[^a]; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
