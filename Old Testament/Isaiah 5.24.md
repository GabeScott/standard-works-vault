# Isaiah 5:24

> Therefore as the fire devoureth the <u>stubble</u>[^a], and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their <u>root</u>[^b] shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
