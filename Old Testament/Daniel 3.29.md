# Daniel 3:29

> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be <u>cut</u>[^a] in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can <u>deliver</u>[^b] after this sort.
