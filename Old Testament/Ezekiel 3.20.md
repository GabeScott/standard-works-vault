# Ezekiel 3:20

> Again, When a <u>righteous</u>[^a] man doth <u>turn</u>[^b] from his <u>righteousness</u>[^c], and commit iniquity, and I lay a <u>stumblingblock</u>[^d] before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
