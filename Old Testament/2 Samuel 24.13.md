# 2 Samuel 24:13

> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of <u>famine</u>[^a] come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three daysâ€™ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
