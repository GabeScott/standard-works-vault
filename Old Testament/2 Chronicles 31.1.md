# 2 Chronicles 31:1

> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the <u>images</u>[^a] in pieces, and cut down the <u>groves</u>[^b], and threw down the <u>high places</u>[^c] and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
