# Jeremiah 2:6

> Neither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that <u>led</u>[^a] us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
