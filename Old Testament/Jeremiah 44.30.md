# Jeremiah 44:30

> Thus saith the Lord ; Behold, I will give <u>Pharaoh-hophra</u>[^a] king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave <u>Zedekiah</u>[^b] king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
