# Proverbs 30:15

> The <u>horseleach</u>[^a] hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:

[Proverbs 30:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/30.15?lang=eng#p15)


[^a]: IE a blood-sucking parasite which is seemingly never satiated.
