# Joshua 8:33

> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord , as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount <u>Gerizim</u>[^a], and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
