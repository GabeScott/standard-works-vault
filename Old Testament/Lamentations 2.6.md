# Lamentations 2:6

> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the Lord hath caused the solemn feasts and <u>sabbaths</u>[^a] to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
