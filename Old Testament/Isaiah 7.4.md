# Isaiah 7:4

> And say unto him, <u>Take heed</u>[^a], and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

[Isaiah 7:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/7.4?lang=eng#p4)


[^a]: IE Donâ€™t be alarmed by the attack; those two kings have little fire left.
