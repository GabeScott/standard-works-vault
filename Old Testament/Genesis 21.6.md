# Genesis 21:6

> ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made me to <u>laugh</u>[^a], so that all that hear will laugh with me.

[Genesis 21:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/21.6?lang=eng#p6)


[^a]: The Hebrew root tzachak means both “to laugh” and “to rejoice”; thus there is double meaning implied in its use here. Gal. 4:27; [[D&C 132.56|D&C 132:56]]. TG [[Laughter, Laugh]].
