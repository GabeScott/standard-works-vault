# Isaiah 50:2

> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my <u>hand</u>[^a] shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no <u>power</u>[^b] to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I <u>dry up</u>[^c] the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.
