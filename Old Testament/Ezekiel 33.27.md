# Ezekiel 33:27

> Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the <u>sword</u>[^a], and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
