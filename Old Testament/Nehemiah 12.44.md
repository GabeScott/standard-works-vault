# Nehemiah 12:44

> Â¶ And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the <u>tithes</u>[^a], to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
