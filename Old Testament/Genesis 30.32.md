# Genesis 30:32

> I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted <u>cattle</u>[^a], and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.

[Genesis 30:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30.32?lang=eng#p32)


[^a]: HEB sheep. “Cattle” is older English for “flock” or “herd” as part of one’s property, or “stock.” Enos 1:21; [[Ether 9.18|Ether 9:18]]; [[Abraham 5.21|Abr. 5:21.]]
