# Numbers 33:54

> And ye shall divide the <u>land</u>[^a] by <u>lot</u>[^b] for an <u>inheritance</u>[^c] among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
