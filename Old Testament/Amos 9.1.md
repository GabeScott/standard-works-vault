# Amos 9:1

> I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will <u>slay</u>[^a] the last of them with the sword: he that <u>fleeth</u>[^b] of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
