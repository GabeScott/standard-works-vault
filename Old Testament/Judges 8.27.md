# Judges 8:27

> And Gideon made an <u>ephod</u>[^a] thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a <u>snare</u>[^b] unto Gideon, and to his house.

[^a]: IE probably here a medallion of gold to adorn the priestâ€™s ephod. Later it was at times revered. Ex. 28:4 (4-35); [[Judges 17.5|Judg. 17:5.]]
[^b]: [[Exodus 23.33|Ex. 23:33.]]
