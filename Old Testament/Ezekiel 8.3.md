# Ezekiel 8:3

> And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the <u>spirit</u>[^a] lifted me up between the earth and the <u>heaven</u>[^b], and brought me in the <u>visions</u>[^c] of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.
