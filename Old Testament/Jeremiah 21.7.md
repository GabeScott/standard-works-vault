> And afterward, saith the Lord , I will deliver <u>Zedekiah</u>[^a] king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of <u>Babylon</u>[^b], and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not <u>spare</u>[^c] them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
