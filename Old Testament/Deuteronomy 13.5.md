# Deuteronomy 13:5

> And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to <u>death</u>[^a]; because he hath spoken to <u>turn</u>[^b] you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to <u>thrust</u>[^c] thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
