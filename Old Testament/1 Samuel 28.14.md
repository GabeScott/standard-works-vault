# 1 Samuel 28:14

> And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, <u>An old man</u>[^a] cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.

[^a]: This cannot be a bona fide vision from God, brought about by a spiritualist medium. See [[1 Samuel 28.15|v. 15]]. Its effect was to destroy all hope. See [[1 Samuel 28.20|v. 20]]; [[1 Samuel 31.1|31:1–4]][[1 Samuel 31.2|]][[1 Samuel 31.3|]][[1 Samuel 31.4|]].
