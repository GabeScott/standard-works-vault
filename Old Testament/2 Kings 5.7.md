# 2 Kings 5:7

> And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I <u>God</u>[^a], to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he <u>seeketh</u>[^b] a quarrel against me.
