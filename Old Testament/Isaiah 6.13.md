# Isaiah 6:13

> Â¶ But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the <u>substance</u>[^b] thereof.

[Isaiah 6:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/6.13?lang=eng#p13)


[^b]: IE like a tree, though its leaves be scattered, life and potential to produce seed yet remain in it.
