# Ezekiel 47:1

> Afterward he brought me again unto the <u>door</u>[^a] of the house; and, behold, <u>waters</u>[^b] issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the <u>house</u>[^c], at the south side of the altar.
