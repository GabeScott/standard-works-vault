# Isaiah 3:7

> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be <u>an healer</u>[^a]; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

[Isaiah 3:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/3.7?lang=eng#p7)


[^a]: HEB a binder up (of a wound); i.e., I cannot solve your problems.
