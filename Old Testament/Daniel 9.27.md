# Daniel 9:27

> And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of <u>abominations</u>[^a] he shall make it <u>desolate</u>[^b], even until the <u>consummation</u>[^c], and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
