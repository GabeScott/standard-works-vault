# Ezekiel 13:9

> And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the <u>writing</u>[^a] of the house of Israel, neither shall they <u>enter</u>[^b] into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God .
