# Joshua 22:19

> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord , wherein the Lord ’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the Lord , nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.
