# 2 Chronicles 26:18

> And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth <u>not</u>[^b] unto thee, Uzziah, to <u>burn</u>[^c] incense unto the Lord , but to the priests the sons of <u>Aaron</u>[^d], that are consecrated to burn <u>incense</u>[^e] : go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the Lord God.
