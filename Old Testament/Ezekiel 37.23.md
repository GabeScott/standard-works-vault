# Ezekiel 37:23

> Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their <u>idols</u>[^a], nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will <u>save</u>[^b] them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will <u>cleanse</u>[^c] them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
