# 2 Chronicles 22:9

> And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had <u>slain</u>[^a] him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the <u>son</u>[^b] of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
