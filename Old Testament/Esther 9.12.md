# Esther 9:12

> ¶ And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy <u>petition</u>[^a] ? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
