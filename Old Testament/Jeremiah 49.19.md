# Jeremiah 49:19

> Behold, he shall come up like a <u>lion</u>[^a] from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
