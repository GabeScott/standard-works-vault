# Isaiah 16:3

> <u>Take counsel</u>[^a], execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.

[Isaiah 16:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/16.3?lang=eng#p3)


[^a]: HEB Give counsel. This begins Moabâ€™s appeal to Judah (vv. 3-5).
