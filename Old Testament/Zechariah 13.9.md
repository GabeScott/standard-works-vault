# Zechariah 13:9

> And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will <u>refine</u>[^a] them as silver is refined, and will <u>try</u>[^b] them as gold is <u>tried</u>[^c] : they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my <u>people</u>[^d] : and they shall say, The Lord is my God.
