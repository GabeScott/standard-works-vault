# Jeremiah 14:14

> Then the Lord said unto me, The <u>prophets</u>[^a] prophesy <u>lies</u>[^b] in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false <u>vision</u>[^c] and divination, and a thing of nought, and the <u>deceit</u>[^d] of their heart.
