# Isaiah 14:19

> But thou art cast out of thy grave like <u>an abominable branch</u>[^a], and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to <u>the stones</u>[^b] of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

[Isaiah 14:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/14.19?lang=eng#p19)


[^a]: IE a rejected branch, pruned off and discarded.  
[^b]: IE the very bottom.
