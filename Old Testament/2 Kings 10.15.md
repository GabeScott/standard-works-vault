# 2 Kings 10:15

> ¶ And when he was departed thence, he lighted on <u>Jehonadab</u>[^a] the son of <u>Rechab</u>[^b] coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
