> ¶ And his <u>feet</u>[^a] shall <u>stand</u>[^b] in that day upon the <u>mount of Olives</u>[^c], which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
