# 1 Kings 8:64

> The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord : for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the <u>brasen altar</u>[^a] that was before the Lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
