# Judges 14:16

> And Samsonâ€™s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a <u>riddle</u>[^a] unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
